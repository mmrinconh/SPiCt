	abstract = {Gene expression is significantly stochastic making modeling of genetic networks challenging. We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance, but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins decay substantially more slowly than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation by using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

	abstract = {Gonosomatic indices and egg and larval densities observed from 1986 to 2001 suggest that the peak spawning season of the Australian anchovy (Engraulis australis) in South Australia occurs during January to March (summer and autumn). This coincides with the spawning season of sardine (Sardinops sagax) and the period when productivity in shelf waters is enhanced by upwelling. Anchovy eggs were abundant throughout gulf and shelf waters, but the highest densities occurred in the northern parts of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent where sea surface temperatures (SST) were 24–26°C. In contrast, larvae {\textgreater}10 mm total length (TL) were found mainly in shelf waters near upwelling zones where SSTs were relatively low ({\textless}20°C) and levels of chlorophyll a (chl a) relatively high. Larvae {\textgreater}15 mm TL were collected only from shelf waters near upwelling zones. The high levels of larval abundance in the upwelling zones may reflect higher levels of recruitment to later stages in these areas compared with the gulfs. The sardine spawns mainly in shelf waters; few eggs and no larvae were collected from the northern gulfs. The abundance of anchovy eggs and larvae in shelf waters increased when sardine abundance was reduced by large-scale mortality events, and decreased as the sardine numbers subsequently recovered. We hypothesize that the upwelling zones provide optimal conditions for the survival of larval anchovy in South Australia, but that anchovy can only utilize these zones effectively when the sardine population is low. At other times, northern gulf waters of South Australia may provide a refuge for the anchovy that the sardine cannot utilize.},

The two surveys were characterised by markedly different hydrographical conditions, partly attributable to a shift from westerly to easterly winds. At the scale studied, larvae of coastal and shelf-dwelling species were always clearly separated from mesopelagic species, probably as a result of well-defined coastal-oceanic habitats related to a wide shelf and the prevailing currents. However, underlying these associations, short-term hydrographic changes induced by wind forcing seemed able to severely affect the distribution patterns of the early stages of some shelf-associated species. In particular, species like the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus were transported off the usual areas of maximal concentrations following a strengthened northwestern coastal countercurrent.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to stock assessment determines the probabilities of alternative hypotheses using information for the stock in question and from inferences for other stocks/species. These probabilities are essential if the consequences of alternative management actions are to be evaluated through a decision analysis. Using the Bayesian approach to stock assessment and decision analysis it becomes possible to admit the full range of uncertainty and use the collective historical experience of fisheries science when estimating the consequences of proposed management actions. Recent advances in computing algorithms and power have allowed methods based on the Bayesian approach to be used even for fairly complex stock assessment models and to be within the reach of most stock assessment scientists. However, to avoid coming to ill-founded conclusions, care must be taken when selecting prior distributions. In particular, selection of priors designed to be noninformative with respect to quantities of interest to management is problematic. The arguments of the paper are illustrated using New Zealand's western stock of hoki, Macruronus novaezelandiae (Merlucciidae) and the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales as examples},

Uncertainty is, however, pervasive and its characterization is essential if we are to understand our effects on ecosystems. Traditional fisheries management has a poor track record for confronting uncertainty, but most management authorities are now committed to a precautionary approach. As a result, some of the most interesting methods for taking account of uncertainty in ecological systems have been developed by fisheries scientists. These methods evaluate the relative performance of different management procedures with the use of mathematical and statistical models that synthesize knowledge and speculation about the system of interest. Recent advances in computer-intensive statistics have made it possible to combine this approach with model fitting, so that the uncertainties and risks associated with different outcomes of management can be quantified. We show how this methodology can be applied to a range of ecological problems where the advice that scientists provide to decision makers is likely to be clouded by uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The meteorological and oceanographic factors that have clear influence on the distribution of Engraulis encrasicolus eggs and larvae in shelf waters of the northeastern sector of the Gulf of Cádiz has been analyzed. Very high concentrations of anchovy eggs and larvae were found in this area during the spawning period (from March 2002 to September of 2002). The shallowness of the water column, the influence of the Guadalquivir River, and the local topography favor the existence of warm and chlorophyll-rich waters in the area, thus offering a favorable environment for the development of eggs and larvae. However, during spring and early summer intense easterlies were observed to cause a decrease of the water temperature by several degrees. Easterlies generate oligotrophic conditions in the area, and their persistence forces the offshore transport of waters over this portion of the shelf, advecting early life stages away from favorable conditions. These negative influences on the development conditions of anchovy eggs and larvae can impact on the recruitment of this species in the Gulf of Cádiz. Therefore, inter-annual fluctuations in the duration of intense easterly winds is analyzed and discussed in connection with anchovy catches.},

Rhône and Ebre interannual fluctuations in run-off were synchronous and were related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), river run-offs being negatively correlated to high NAO episodes. The fluctuations of river discharges and the wind mixing index were cyclic but not related. The results showed that enhanced hydroclimatic conditions in the NW Mediterranean were favourable for the productivity of the fish and invertebrate stocks, and suggest the presence of linkage between recruitment of Mediterranean species and local (river discharges, wind conditions) and global (NAO) environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {In the mid 1970s, the fishery catch of postlarval Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonica) in a shelf region of the Enshu-nada Sea, off the central Pacific coast of Japan, started to decline corresponding to a rapid increase of postlarval sardine (Sardinops melanostictus). In late 1980s, sardine started to decline, and it was replaced by anchovy in the 1990s. This alternating dominance of postlarval sardine and anchovy corresponded to the alternation in egg abundance of these two species in the spawning habitat of this sea. It was also noteworthy that during the period of sardine decline, sardine spawning occurred in April–May, a delay of two months compared with spawning in the late 1970s.The implication of oceanographic changes in the spawning habitat for the alternating dominance of sardine and anchovy eggs was explored using time-series data obtained in 1975–1998, focusing on the effect of the Kuroshio meander. Large meanders of the Kuroshio may have enhanced the onshore intrusion of the warm water into the shelf region and contributed to an increase in temperature in the spawning habitat. This might favour sardine, because its egg abundance in the shelf region was more dependent on the temperature in early spring than was that of anchovy. In addition, enhanced onshore intrusion could contribute to transport of sardine larvae from upstream spawning grounds of the Kuroshio region. On the other hand, anchovy egg abundance was more closely related to lower transparency at the shelf edge, which may indicate the prevalence and prolonged residence of the coastal water, and therefore higher food availability, frequently accompanying non-meandering Kuroshio.The expansion/shrinkage of the spawning habitat of sardine and anchovy in the shelf region, apparently responding to the change in the Kuroshio, possibly makes the alternation in dominance of postlarval sardine and anchovy most prominent in the Enshu-nada Sea, in combination with changes in the abundance of spawning adults, which occurred almost simultaneously in the overall Kuroshio region. The implication of this rather regional feature for the alternating dominance of sardine and anchovy populations on a larger spatial scale is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Climatic warming is affecting oceanic circulation patterns in coastal upwelling areas, but the impact of this climatic change on pelagic fish populations remains unclear. From juvenile landings collected over 38 years, the thresholds of environmental factors were determined that limited the optimal environmental window (OEW) for sardine (Sardina pilchardus recruitment success in the northwestern Iberian peninsula. The environmental factors considered were: water column stability in February, offshore water transport in March–April (QxMA), upwelling intensity in the preceding year from May to August (QxMJJA), and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. From 1875 to the mid-1920s, the mean number of years within the OEW was relatively constant. However, since the mid-1920s, there have been oscillations and alternating decades with high and low number of years within the OEW, which were related to oscillations in sardine landings. From 1906 to 2000, there were four record, low sardine catches in the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, related to a high number of successive years with prevailing conditions out of the OEW. From 1875 to the present, a high year-to-year variation of the NAO, QxMJJA and water stability in February was observed, although with mean values usually within the OEW. The collapse in the 1950s was related, partly, to successive years with low QxMJJA. Successive years with high NAO values may be related to the collapse of the sardine fishery in the 1990s. QxMA has been the most significant factor controlling SRS in this area, being the factor related to the low catches observed in the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. Water stability was not responsible for any of the collapses observed, but since the 1920s, there has been a significant trend toward decreasing water column stability before the onset of the spring bloom.},

Models to resolve this complexity often become too sophisticated, with too many assumptions and, consequently, with little capacity to predict beyond calibration data. In this paper we implement a different procedure where the model is kept simple and uncertainty accounts for the equation imperfectness to reproduce ecological complexity. Human and environmental forcing on an anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) stock are simulated with only six parameters plus their error terms, and the uncertainty is computed with Bayesian methods. The simple structure is able to reproduce the major dynamical features of this species in the Gulf of Cádiz, including data on life stages and age structure that had no contact with the model. This is a distinct performance for a frugal approach working on a mid-trophic species and a positive instance where parsimony can simulate the interaction of man, fish and the environment, provided uncertainty is accounted for in the process.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian state-space modelling framework allows us to derive inferences on stochastic stage-structured population dynamics models from multiple series of sequential observations with measurement or sampling errors. A state-space model works from the coupling of two models. The first one mimics the dynamics by conditional Markovian transitions between successive hidden states. The second model describes the observation process with random errors. Statistical inferences on states variables and parameters are easily performed via Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) methods. The flexibility of MCMC methods allows us to analyse a wide range of state-space models with non-linear relationships in the dynamic and observation equations, and non-Gaussian error structure just as well. The Bayesian paradigm is efficient for deriving quantitative diagnostics on a probability based rationale. We illustrate the value of this framework by fitting a stage-structured life cycle model for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to a data set resulting from the survey of the population of the river Oir (Lower Normandy, France) between 1984 and 2001. The system dynamics includes non-linear regulation and has a probabilistic structure accommodating for both the environmental and the demographic stochasticity. The observation model consists in capture-mark-recapture experiments for the evaluation of the runs of downstream migrating juveniles (smolts) and upstream migrating spawners, and random sampling for demographic features. A full Bayesian treatment of the model is carried out by means of Gibbs sampling. Outputs of main interest consist in the joint posterior distribution of all the model parameters and state variables such as the smolt and spawner runs.},

Two adjectives can sum up the characteristics of pelagic species: variability and instability. Analyses of the relationships between small pelagic fish and their physical environment at different time-scales illustrate the complexity of the interplay between exploitation and environmental impacts. How small pelagic fish species are positioned and related within the trophic web suggests that these species play a central role in the functioning and dynamics of upwelling ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the sustainable exploitation of small pelagic fisheries through appropriate management, focusing on the resilience to exploitation, a comparison of different management options and regulatory mechanisms.

	abstract = {Time series of commercial landings from the Algarve (southern Portugal) from 1982 to 1999 were analyzed using min/max autocorrelation factor analysis (MAFA) and dynamic factor analysis (DFA). These techniques were used to identify trends and explore the relationships between the response variables (annual landings of 12 species) and explanatory variables [sea surface temperature, rainfall, an upwelling index, Guadiana river (south-east Portugal) flow, the North Atlantic oscillation, the number of licensed fishing vessels and the number of commercial fishermen]. Landings were more highly correlated with non-lagged environmental variables and in particular with Guadiana river flow. Both techniques gave coherent results, with the most important trend being a steady decline over time. A DFA model with two explanatory variables (Guadiana river flow and number of fishermen) and three common trends (smoothing functions over time) gave good fits to 10 of the 12 species. Results of other models indicated that river flow is the more important explanatory variable in this model. Changes in the mean flow and discharge regime of the Guadiana river resulting from the construction of the Alqueva dam, completed in 2002, are therefore likely to have a significant and deleterious impact on Algarve fisheries landings.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to describe the reproductive cycle of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) off the south coast of Sicily and determine whether intra- and inter-annual reproductive trait variations, if any, are adaptive responses which maximize reproductive success under environmental fluctuations. Biological data were collected from purse seine and mid-water pelagic trawl commercial catches landed in Sciacca (Sicily) over 6 yr (1997–2002) at fortnightly intervals, analysing a total of 84 581 individuals. No inter-annual changes in length at first reproduction were observed, with a mean pooled value of 11.26 cm for both sexes being found. Spawning intensity, indicated by gonadosomatic index, condition factor and length–weight relationships, seem to be governed by food availability prior to spawning. Anchovy reproductive investment was limited by the area's low primary production. There was a synchrony between reproductive cycle and temperature. Water warming marks the onset of a period of high water stability in the area, and its later cooling marks the onset of a period with low water stability. The relationship between reproductive cycle and temperature is therefore probably a reproductive strategy having evolved to ensure that spawning takes place during the period of the year when water column stability is higher, favouring food concentration and egg and larval retention in the spawning areas.},

	abstract = {Since the late 1980s, the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) has been applied to several anchovy stocks in European waters. DEPM surveys in the Bay of Biscay were well standardized and focused on providing fisheries-independent information for stock assessment purposes. Those targeting Mediterranean stocks were largely experimental and often opportunistic, with the main aim of developing and testing the method, rather than providing estimates of spawning stock biomass (SSB) for stock assessment. Consequently, the DEPM has been applied once, twice, or a maximum of three times in certain Mediterranean areas with no among-area standardization. Different techniques for several aspects of the method have been used in the Mediterranean, and the parameters estimated vary greatly among stocks and year of application. Evidence is provided that variability in biological production among sub-basins and/or years, a characteristic of Mediterranean Sea, may directly affect anchovy egg production. The daily specific fecundity of anchovy stocks can vary greatly among years, areas, or seasons in response to changing environmental and trophic regimes. When the correlation between regression-derived estimates of daily egg production and associated estimates of daily specific fecundity for anchovy in the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, and upwelling areas are compared, a significant isometric relationship emerges for the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay, implying density-dependent use of spawning habitat. In upwelling areas, estimates of daily egg production are relatively high for a narrow range of generally low daily specific fecundities. There is a strong linear relationship between anchovy SSB and spawning area in European waters that does not differ significantly between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean Sea.},

By the end of 2005, 36 hake and five tags had been returned to the laboratory (a 3.1\% return rate) with a maximum time at liberty of 1066 days. The somatic growth of the recoveries proved to be twofold higher than that expected from published von Bertalanffy growth functions for the species in the Bay of Biscay. The growth underestimation was related to age overestimation, as demonstrated by two independent analyses. The first was based on a blind interpretation of marked otoliths conducted independently by two European experts involved in the routine age estimation of hake. The result shows that the age estimates were neither accurate (inconsistent with oxytetracycline mark positions) nor precise. The second approach compared the predicted otolith growth with the observed growth, and the discrepancy between the two data sets was large. Both types of analyses invalidate the internationally agreed age estimation method and demonstrate a need for further research. Although based on limited data, the study highlights the need to improve biological knowledge of the species in order to improve assessment and management advice. It also strengthens the argument for age validation.},

The aim of this chapter is to review the biology and fishery, including the management, of European hake in the north-east Atlantic. The European hake is widely distributed throughout the north-east Atlantic, from Norway in the north to the Guinea Gulf in the south, and throughout the Mediterranean and Black Sea, being more abundant from the British Isles to the south of Spain. In this area, ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) recognises the existence of two stocks: the northern stock and the southern stock. Both stocks have been extensively and intensively harvested and since the beginning of the 90s have been considered to be outside safe biological limits. The northern stock, however, is currently considered to lie within safe biological limits. In any case, recovery plans were implemented for the northern stock in 2004 and for the southern stock in 2006. Despite its commercial importance, knowledge of the biology and ecology of the European hake in the North Atlantic is still quite scarce. For example, recent investigations suggest that European hake grows much faster, by a factor of two, than was considered previously. This faster growth also affects the maturity-at-age pattern of hake and the agreed maturity-at-age ogive used in the assessments. European hake is a top predator in the demersal community in the north-east Atlantic area; mainly preying on blue whiting, horse mackerel and other cupleids. In relation to the reproductive biology, European hake is considered to be a batch spawner species with indeterminate fecundity and spawning activity all year round. All these characteristics could, in turn, be interpreted as European hake adopting a more opportunistic life strategy, which is unusual for a gadoid and demersal species, and raises several questions about hake biology and ecology that require further investigation.},

Fifteen months after tagging, seven individuals (1.3\%) had been recaptured with times at liberty ranging from 29 to 466 days. We provide the first direct measurements of growth rates of Southern stock European hake in the wild and compare them with rates obtained from tagging experiments in other regions and with rates derived from conventional otolith age reading. The mean somatic growth rate of all recaptured hake was 0.032 ± 0.016 cm day−1 (sexes combined), while the mean growth rate of the two hake with over 340 days at liberty was 0.052 ± 0.003 cm day−1 (sexes unknown).

	abstract = {European hake (Merluccius merluccius) were caught alive in the northern Bay of Biscay in June/July 2002, using a codend specially designed to avoid crushing fish and also to retain water while hauling the trawl. In all, 1307 fish were tagged with anchor T-bar tags, injected with tetracycline, then released. The length range of the tagged and marked fish varied from 13 to 58 cm, and the modal size was 28 cm, at which length they were assumed to be 2–3 years old. A mean survival rate of 68.2\% was estimated. Mortality was mainly caused by stress of capture and physical damage, and depended on the size of the catch and the depth of trawling. By the end of March 2003, 32 fish and three tags had been returned to the laboratory (a 2.7\% return rate), the recapture data indicating that the probability of survival after release does not depend on catch depth or depth at location of release. For combined sexes, the somatic growth rate was estimated at 0.033 ± 0.019 cm day−1 (n=15). Males and females did not differ significantly in somatic growth rate, which were, respectively, 0.028±0.018 (n=6) and 0.033 ± 0.012 cm day−1 (n=6). This pilot experiment represents the first recorded mass tagging of European hake, which is known to be a very fragile species. The preliminary results indicate that it would be possible to carry out a large-scale tagging experiment of the European stocks in order to improve assessment and subsequent management decisions.},

At the scale studied, larvae of coastal and shelf-dwelling species were always clearly separated from mesopelagic species, probably as a result of well-defined coastal-oceanic habitats related to a wide shelf and the prevailing currents. However, underlying these associations, short-term hydrographic changes induced by wind forcing seemed able to severely affect the distribution patterns of the early stages of some shelf-associated species. In particular, species like the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus were transported off the usual areas of maximal concentrations following a strengthened northwestern coastal countercurrent.},

	abstract = {Previous surveys of population structure in the Atlantic-Mediterranean anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus L. have reported heterogeneity in morphology, allozyme frequencies, and mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies at a regional scale. In particular, two stocks of anchovy have been detected in the Adriatic Sea. In this paper, the available data is reviewed with the aim to relate genetic variation to geography at the widest possible geographical scale, for investigating the evolutionary mechanisms underlying stock structure in anchovy. Correspondence analysis of allozyme frequencies (24 samples, three polymorphic loci) compiled from the literature indicates three distinct entities in the Mediterranean Sea. Open-sea or oceanic anchovy populations are genetically different from inshore-water populations within a region (Nei’s {\textasciicircum}GST = 0.035–0.067), while broadscale geographical variation is weak for each of these two habitat-specific forms ({\textasciicircum}GST = 0.005–0.006). Mitochondrial-DNA haplotype frequencies support the distinction between an inshore form and an oceanic form ({\textasciicircum}GST = 0.067–0.107), with virtually no genetic differences among oceanic populations across the Gulf of Biscay, the western Mediterranean and the Ionian Sea ({\textasciicircum}GST = −0.001). If natural selection on marker loci is unimportant, these results indicate the occurrence of two parapatric, genetically distinct, habitat-specific forms that are widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Persistent allele and haplotype-frequency differences between these forms indicate reproductive isolation and the presence of an E. encrasicolus species complex in the Mediterranean. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society75: 261–269.},

However, these studies have been limited in their power to detect some aspects of population structure by the use of a single or a few molecular markers, or by limited geographic sampling. We use a multi-marker approach, 47 nDNA and 15 mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to analyze 626 European anchovies from the whole range of the species to resolve shallow and deep levels of population structure. Nuclear SNPs define 10 genetic entities within two larger genetically distinctive groups associated with oceanic variables and different life-history traits. MtDNA SNPs define two deep phylogroups that reflect ancient dispersals and colonizations. These markers define two ecological groups. One major group of Iberian-Atlantic populations is associated with upwelling areas on narrow continental shelves and includes populations spawning and overwintering in coastal areas. A second major group includes northern populations in the North East (NE) Atlantic (including the Bay of Biscay) and the Mediterranean and is associated with wide continental shelves with local larval retention currents. This group tends to spawn and overwinter in oceanic areas. These two groups encompass ten populations that differ from previously defined management stocks in the Alboran Sea, Iberian-Atlantic and Bay of Biscay regions. In addition, a new North Sea-English Channel stock is defined. SNPs indicate that some populations in the Bay of Biscay are genetically closer to North Western (NW) Mediterranean populations than to other populations in the NE Atlantic, likely due to colonizations of the Bay of Biscay and NW Mediterranean by migrants from a common ancestral population. Northern NE Atlantic populations were subsequently established by migrants from the Bay of Biscay. Populations along the Iberian-Atlantic coast appear to have been founded by secondary waves of migrants from a southern refuge.},

	abstract = {The ‘constant M axiom’ refers to the often automatic assumption made in fish stock assessment, that the instantaneous natural mortality rate, expressed on an annual basis, is constant throughout the exploited phase of the life history. This uncritical assumption or axiom has come under criticism in recent years, best documented by field determinations of predation rates on juvenile fish coordinated in the North Sea through the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). These, and earlier studies, have yielded empirical vectors of predation-related M for juveniles of key species, and in some cases, also for egg and larval stages. To date, perhaps the mathematical function with the widest acceptance for modelling M-at-age in the animal kingdom has been the Weibull distribution. This paper attempts to demonstrate, for a limited sample of highly fecund marine organisms, that a simple, two-parameter reciprocal function of age is a more reasonable, and mathematically parsimonious, description of the form of the life history M-vector between egg and larval stages and the mean parental age (MPA). Mortality rates may increase later in life, especially for semelparous species, and in this case would need to be described by an additional or more complex function, beyond the scope of this paper. Seasonal and inter-annual variations in M-at-age, though rarely documented, also occur; in the latter case, when associated with density dependence, they give rise to the stock-recruit relationships described in the literature, and lead to annual divergences from mean expectation of death, especially for the earliest life-history stages. Contrary to preconception, however, there seems no overwhelming evidence from egg and larval studies for the consistent action of a critical period: the very high egg and larval M-at-age values predicted by the reciprocal function, though continuous in time, effectively correspond to catastrophic early mortality rates, but provide a mean expectation of death with age that converges smoothly on a constant M value at greater ages. The use of any steeply declining mortality function of age, in simulating survivorship over a time period T between spawning and maturity of the succeeding generation, reveals a serious difficulty in defining appropriate time units. It is concluded that if the reciprocal mortality function applies, then simulating constant survivors at time T independently of the number of smaller time units (Δt) that T is divided into, is effectively accomplished by using progressively longer time intervals with age t, such that Δt/t is constant for all intervals. This is referred to as ‘proportional time allocation’. Calculations assuming population stability, and using indicative values for mean lifetime fecundity (MLF) and mean parental age (MPA), are presented for a generalized demersal and a generalized small pelagic fish, employing the reciprocal function with proportional time allocation. Sets of values for the two parameters of the reciprocal function were not rejected, even though non-unique, if they reduced the MLF to two individuals by MPA, and a unique vector of M-at-age presumably could be determined if the ‘constant adult M’ is already known. The new model has the advantage of being compatible with the ‘constant adult M’ hypothesis over periods of roughly 4–5 and 1+ years, respectively, for generalized northern demersals and small pelagics, over the ages just preceding MPA. The possibility of extension of this model to length-based methods, and its analogies with crustacean moulting models, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Gulf of Cádiz, strategically situated between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, has been the focus of attention of a few oceanographic studies dealing with the deep circulation in order to understand the dynamics of the dense plume of Mediterranean water. Much less attention has been paid to the surface pelagic layer which holds important living resources of commercial and ecological interest. This overview summarizes the recent advances that have been made concerning the regional oceanography of the northern half of this important basin from an interdisciplinary point of view. Probably the most relevant oceanographic feature of the basin is its strong seasonality, which is linked to the meteorologically-induced seasonality of the eastern boundary current system of the North Atlantic. The prominent cape Santa Maria divides the continental shelf off the southern Iberian Peninsula in two shelves of different shape that hold different oceanographic processes, which in turn determine the characteristics of the pelagic ecosystem. Mass and energy inputs from land as well as tidally-driven processes makes the wider eastern shelf be more productive while the narrower western shelf, cut by a sharp submarine canyon, is under the influence of the almost-permanent upwelling spot off cape San Vicente. Under easterlies, the west-going, warm coastal countercurrent that is observed in the eastern shelf may invade the western shelf thus connecting biologically both shelves in an east-to-west direction. Westerlies induce generalised upwelling off the southern Iberia Peninsula, which adds to the almost-permanent one off cape San Vicente and generates an upwelling jet that moves eastwards. Cape Santa Maria may deflect this flow by generating a cold filament that extends southward and diverts water from the western shelf to the open ocean. This pattern of circulation hampers the biological connection between shelves in the west-to-east direction, which is therefore less effective. The eastern shelf is prone to hold a cyclonic circulation cell during summer. This cell seems to be part of the reproductive strategy of fish species like anchovy with significant commercial interest in the region. The coupling between spawning and circulation is particularly beneficial under westerlies, when productivity in the eastern shelf is enhanced and the plankton is confined within the cyclonic cell. Easterlies favour oligotrophy and the westward export of plankton, which has an adverse effect on the recruitment and correlates low anchovy catches with periods of noticeable easterly intensity.},

These techniques were used to identify trends and explore the relationships between the response variables (annual landings of 12 species) and explanatory variables [sea surface temperature, rainfall, an upwelling index, Guadiana river (south-east Portugal) flow, the North Atlantic oscillation, the number of licensed fishing vessels and the number of commercial fishermen]. Landings were more highly correlated with non-lagged environmental variables and in particular with Guadiana river flow. Both techniques gave coherent results, with the most important trend being a steady decline over time. A DFA model with two explanatory variables (Guadiana river flow and number of fishermen) and three common trends (smoothing functions over time) gave good fits to 10 of the 12 species. Results of other models indicated that river flow is the more important explanatory variable in this model. Changes in the mean flow and discharge regime of the Guadiana river resulting from the construction of the Alqueva dam, completed in 2002, are therefore likely to have a significant and deleterious impact on Algarve fisheries landings.},

Exploited stocks of these species are prone to large interannual and interdecadal variation of abundance as well as to collapse. We discuss why small pelagic fish and fisheries are so "special" with regard to their biology, ecology, and behavior. Two adjectives can sum up the characteristics of pelagic species: variability and instability. Analyses of the relationships between small pelagic fish and their physical environment at different time-scales illustrate the complexity of the interplay between exploitation and environmental impacts. How small pelagic fish species are positioned and related within the trophic web suggests that these species play a central role in the functioning and dynamics of upwelling ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the sustainable exploitation of small pelagic fisheries through appropriate management, focusing on the resilience to exploitation, a comparison of different management options and regulatory mechanisms. We recommend that statistical, socio-economical, and political merits of a proposed two-level (short- and long-term) management strategy be undertaken.},

The shallowness of the water column, the influence of the Guadalquivir River, and the local topography favor the existence of warm and chlorophyll-rich waters in the area, thus offering a favorable environment for the development of eggs and larvae. However, during spring and early summer intense easterlies were observed to cause a decrease of the water temperature by several degrees. Easterlies generate oligotrophic conditions in the area, and their persistence forces the offshore transport of waters over this portion of the shelf, advecting early life stages away from favorable conditions. These negative influences on the development conditions of anchovy eggs and larvae can impact on the recruitment of this species in the Gulf of Cádiz.

	abstract = {Since the late 1980s, the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) has been applied to several anchovy stocks in European waters. DEPM surveys in the Bay of Biscay were well standardized and focused on providing fisheries-independent information for stock assessment purposes. Those targeting Mediterranean stocks were largely experimental and often opportunistic, with the main aim of developing and testing the method, rather than providing estimates of spawning stock biomass (SSB) for stock assessment. Consequently, the DEPM has been applied once, twice, or a maximum of three times in certain Mediterranean areas with no among-area standardization. Different techniques for several aspects of the method have been used in the Mediterranean, and the parameters estimated vary greatly among stocks and year of application. Evidence is provided that variability in biological production among sub-basins and/or years, a characteristic of Mediterranean Sea, may directly affect anchovy egg production. The daily specific fecundity of anchovy stocks can vary greatly among years, areas, or seasons in response to changing environmental and trophic regimes. When the correlation between regression-derived estimates of daily egg production and associated estimates of daily specific fecundity for anchovy in the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, and upwelling areas are compared, a significant isometric relationship emerges for the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay, implying density-dependent use of spawning habitat. In upwelling areas, estimates of daily egg production are relatively high for a narrow range of generally low daily specific fecundities. There is a strong linear relationship between anchovy SSB and spawning area in European waters that does not differ significantly between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean Sea.},

Uncertainty affects the behaviour of fishers and fisheries regulators in a way that can adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks, fisheries income, and productivity. In agriculture, there has been a long history of using levy funds and public and private insurance schemes to mediate economic risks to growers resulting from environmental variability and quarantine risks. In the United States, the federal government continues to underwrite funds (collected by contracted private agents) that are used to protect contributors from the effects of extreme weather and pest and disease losses. In Europe, there are examples of industry-based mutual funds to mediate risks from exotic agricultural diseases. In agriculture, insurance mechanisms have been successful in reducing risk-inducing behaviour by contractual compliance to risk-reducing codes of practice. For fisheries, insurance may provide a tool to address some elements of uncertainty in a way that would help both the fishing industry and the regulators achieve objectives of sustainability, income security, and productivity. This paper presents a brief review of insurance in agriculture and capture fisheries and uses a stochastic model to illustrate how insurance funds could protect revenue and encourage increased sustainability of fisheries and improve compliance with and enforcement of fisheries regulation. Although insurance may be a partial solution to unsatisfactory fisheries management and fishing performance, some potential challenges to this novel approach are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Over the past two decades, populations of rockfish Sebastes spp. off the U.S. West Coast have declined sharply, leading to heightened concern about the sustainability of current harvest policies for these populations. In this paper, I develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to jointly estimate the stock−recruit relationships of rockfish stocks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Stock−recruit curves for individual stocks are linked using a prior distribution for the “steepness” parameter of the Beverton–Holt stock−recruit curve, defined as the expected recruitment at 20\% of unfished biomass relative to unfished recruitment. The choice of a spawning biomass per recruit (SPR) harvest rate is considered a problem in decision theory, in which different options are evaluated in the presence of uncertainty in the stock−recruit relationship. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to obtain the marginal distributions of variables of interest to management, such as the yield at a given SPR rate. A wide range of expected yield curves were obtained for different rockfish stocks. The stocks of Pacific ocean perch S. alutus in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands are apparently the most resilient, with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) harvest rates greater than F 30\% (the fishing mortality rate that reduces SPR to 30\% of its unfished value) for all model configurations. In contrast, the MSY harvest rate for the West Coast stock of Pacific ocean perch was lower than F 70\%. The SPR rates at MSY for other stocks were clustered between F 40\% and F 60\% and depended on both the stock−recruit model (Beverton–Holt or Ricker) and the model for recruitment variability (lognormal or gamma). Meta-analysis results should be interpreted cautiously due to autocorrelation in the model residuals for several stocks and the potential confounding effect of decadal variation in ecosystem productivity. An F 40\% harvest rate, the current default harvest rate for rockfish, exceeded the estimated F MSY rate for all West Coast rockfish stocks with the exception of black rockfish S. melanops. A harvest rate of F 50\% is suggested as a risk-neutral F MSY proxy for rockfish. A more risk-averse alternative would be to apply an SPR harvest rate in the F 55\%−F 60\% range.},

Combining different stockrecruit data sets of related species through Bayesian hierarchical analysis can decrease these uncertainties and help to characterize appropriate stockrecruit forms and ranges of plausible parameter values. Two different stockrecruit functions (BevertonHolt and Ricker) have been parameterized in terms of the steepness, which is a parameter that is comparable between populations. In the hierarchical analysis, the prior probability distribution of parameters for the cross-population variation in steepness is determined through a concise model structure. By calculating the Bayes' posteriors for alternative model forms, model uncertainty is accounted for. This methodology has been applied to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stockrecruit data to provide predictions for the steepness of the stockrecruit function ..., Les fonctions stockrecrutement sont de grande importance pour l'évaluation des stocks des pêches commerciales, mais il y a souvent de l'incertitude au sujet du choix d'un modèle approprié et des valeurs de ses paramètres.

Models to resolve this complexity often become too sophisticated, with too many assumptions and, consequently, with little capacity to predict beyond calibration data. In this paper we implement a different procedure where the model is kept simple and uncertainty accounts for the equation imperfectness to reproduce ecological complexity. Human and environmental forcing on an anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) stock are simulated with only six parameters plus their error terms, and the uncertainty is computed with Bayesian methods. The simple structure is able to reproduce the major dynamical features of this species in the Gulf of Cádiz, including data on life stages and age structure that had no contact with the model. This is a distinct performance for a frugal approach working on a mid-trophic species and a positive instance where parsimony can simulate the interaction of man, fish and the environment, provided uncertainty is accounted for in the process.},

New insights on European hake biology and population dynamics from a sustained tagging effort in the Bay of Biscay. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: . Following a pilot experiment that fundamentally challenged the knowledge of European hake life traits (growth and age at first maturity), a sustained tagging effort was carried out in the Bay of Biscay from 2004 to 2007. Out of 27 690 fish tagged between 2002 and 2007, 1199 (4.3\%) have been recovered to date. These data have permitted a refinement of the growth parameters of the species, analysis of interannual variability, improved understanding of movements and migrations, and an examination of natural (M) and fishing mortality (F). Both L∞ and K of a von Bertalanffy growth model could be estimated using a robust non-linear regression procedure. Growth varied significantly between years, which is likely related to variation in environmental factors such as temperature. Data did not reveal seasonal movements of fish perhaps because of poor tag return rates from offshore fleets. However, results clearly revealed homing behaviour and/or inshore residency. Confounding factors hindered the estimation of mortality, which resulted in high estimates of M. The outcomes of this experiment led to substantial changes in the stock assessment conducted by ICES and call into question the findings of previous studies that have used erroneous age-based data to address topics on the ecology and dynamics of this species.},

	abstract = {Since the days of Elton, population cycles have challenged ecologists and resource managers. Although the underlying mechanisms remain debated, theory holds that both density-dependent and density-independent processes shape the dynamics. One striking example is the large-scale fluctuations of sardine and anchovy observed across the major upwelling areas of the world. Despite a long history of research, the causes of these fluctuations remain unresolved and heavily debated, with significant implications for fisheries management. We here model the underlying causes of these fluctuations, using the California Current Ecosystem as a case study, and show that the dynamics, accurately reproduced since A.D. 1661 onward, are explained by interacting density-dependent processes (i.e., through species-specific life-history traits) and climate forcing. Furthermore, we demonstrate how fishing modifies the dynamics and show that the sardine collapse of the 1950s was largely unavoidable given poor recruitment conditions. Our approach provides unique insight into the origin of sardine–anchovy fluctuations and a knowledge base for sustainable fisheries management in the California Current Ecosystem and beyond.},

	abstract = {Understanding which species are most vulnerable to human impacts is a prerequisite for designing effective conservation strategies. Surveys of terrestrial species have suggested that large-bodied species and top predators are the most at risk, and it is commonly assumed that such patterns also apply in the ocean. However, there has been no global test of this hypothesis in the sea. We analyzed two fisheries datasets (stock assessments and landings) to determine the life-history traits of species that have suffered dramatic population collapses. Contrary to expectations, our data suggest that up to twice as many fisheries for small, low trophic-level species have collapsed compared with those for large predators. These patterns contrast with those on land, suggesting fundamental differences in the ways that industrial fisheries and land conversion affect natural communities. Even temporary collapses of small, low trophic-level fishes can have ecosystem-wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

	abstract = {We review the applicability of Bayesian networks (BNs) for discovering relations between genes, environment, and disease. By translating probabilistic dependencies among variables into graphical models and vice versa, BNs provide a comprehensible and modular framework for representing complex systems. We first describe the Bayesian network approach and its applicability to understanding the genetic and environmental basis of disease. We then describe a variety of algorithms for learning the structure of a network from observational data. Because of their relevance to real-world applications, the topics of missing data and causal interpretation are emphasized. The BN approach is then exemplified through application to data from a population-based study of bladder cancer in New Hampshire, USA. For didactical purposes, we intentionally keep this example simple. When applied to complete data records, we find only minor differences in the performance and results of different algorithms. Subsequent incorporation of partial records through application of the EM algorithm gives us greater power to detect relations. Allowing for network structures that depart from a strict causal interpretation also enhances our ability to discover complex associations including gene-gene (epistasis) and gene-environment interactions. While BNs are already powerful tools for the genetic dissection of disease and generation of prognostic models, there remain some conceptual and computational challenges. These include the proper handling of continuous variables and unmeasured factors, the explicit incorporation of prior knowledge, and the evaluation and communication of the robustness of substantive conclusions to alternative assumptions and data manifestations.},

For example, dynamic Bayesian network methods and methods that use the framework of finite dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, all take discrete input. Experimental data, however, are typically continuous and represented by computer floating point numbers. The translation from continuous to discrete data is crucial in preserving the variable dependencies and thus has a significant impact on the performance of the network inference algorithms. We compare the performance of two such algorithms that use discrete data using several different discretization algorithms. One of the inference methods uses a dynamic Bayesian network framework, the other—a time-and state-discrete dynamical system framework. The discretization algorithms are quantile, interval discretization, and a new algorithm introduced in this article, SSD. SSD is especially designed for short time series data and is capable of determining the optimal number of discretization states. The experiments show that both inference methods perform better with SSD than with the other methods. In addition, SSD is demonstrated to preserve the dynamic features of the time series, as well as to be robust to noise in the experimental data. A C++ implementation of SSD is available from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization.},

The algebraic structure of probabilities is characterized. The prior probabilities of instantiations and the marginal probabilities are shown to be rational functions of the parameters, where the polynomials appearing in the numerator and the denominator are at the most first degree in each of the parameters. It is shown that numeric propagation algorithms can be adapted for symbolic computations by means of canonical components. Furthermore, the same algorithms can be used to build automatic code generators for symbolic propagation of evidence. An example of uncertainty propagation in a clique tree is used to illustrate all the steps and the corresponding code in Mathematica is given. Finally, it is shown that upper and lower bounds for the marginal probabilities of nodes are attained at one of the canonical components. 1},

	abstract = {Inter-annual variability of calculated barotropic (netflow) and simulated baroclinic (inflow and outflow) exchanges through the Strait of Gibraltar is analyzed and their response to the main modes of atmospheric variability is investigated. Time series of the outflow obtained by high resolution simulations and estimated from in-situ Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) current measurements are compared. The time coefficients (TC) of the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes that describe zonal atmospheric circulation in the vicinity of the Strait (1st and 3rd of Sea-Level Pressure (SLP) and 1st of the wind) show significant covariance with the inflow and outflow. Based on these analyses, a regression model between these SLP TCs and outflow of the Mediterranean Water was developed. This regression outflow time series was compared with estimates based on current meter observations and the predictability and reconstruction of past exchange variability based on atmospheric pressure fields are discussed. The simple regression model seems to reproduce the outflow evolution fairly reasonably, with the exception of the year 2008, which is apparently anomalous without available physical explanation yet.
The exchange time series show a reduced inter-annual variability (less than 1\%, 2.6\% and 3.1\% of total 2-day variability, for netflow, inflow and outflow, respectively). From a statistical point of view no clear long-term tendencies were revealed. Anomalously high baroclinic fluxes are reported for the years of 2000–2001 that are coincident with strong impact on the Alboran Sea ecosystem. The origin of the anomalous flow is associated with a strong negative anomaly ({\textasciitilde} − 9 hPa) in atmospheric pressure fields settled north of Iberian Peninsula and extending over the central Atlantic, favoring an increased zonal circulation in winter 2000/2001. These low pressure fields forced intense and durable westerly winds in the Gulf of Cadiz–Alboran system. The signal of this anomaly is also seen in time coefficients of the most significant EOF modes.
The predictability of the exchanges for future climate is discussed.},

The report concentrates on the currently available models representative of general types such as bionergetic models, predator-prey models and minimally realistic models. Short descriptions are given of model parameters, assumptions and data requirements. Some of the advantages, disadvantages and limitations of each of the approaches in addressing questions pertaining to EAF are discussed.

Combining these two methodologies facilitates the fitting of state space models that may be non-linear and have non-normal errors, and hence it is particularly useful for modelling fisheries dynamics.

The state space approach allows for random variability in both the data (the measurement of relative biomass) and in annual biomass dynamics of the tuna stock. Sampling from the joint posterior distribution of the unobservables was achieved by using Metropolis-Hastings within-Gibbs sampling.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

A major cause of uncertainty in the population biology of exploited species is the lack of very long time-series; this can be overcome by examining data on many populations (over 500 are examined here). We describe how meta-analysis can be used to address the fundamental problems of population biology and management, e.g. the relationship between spawner abundance and recruitment, the existence of depensation, the estimation of the limits of fishing.

A detailed evolutionary theory is developed and tested for the allometric structure of life histories in female mammals. The symmetry perspective is also applied to studies of aging as well as to the study of allometry in population dynamics.

The overall goal is to develop a common framework to facilitate collaboration within and across disciplines (e.g. biological, ecological, statistical, mathematical, economic, and social) and, in particular, to ensure that new modelling methods and software are more easily validated and evaluated, as well as becoming widely available once developed. Specifically, the framework details how to implement and link a variety of fishery, biological, and economic software packages so that alternative management strategies and procedures can be evaluated for their robustness to uncertainty before implementation. The design of the framework, including the adoption of object-orientated programming, its feasibility to be extended to new processes, and its application to new management approaches (e.g. ecosystem affects of fishing), is discussed. The importance of open source for promoting transparency and allowing technology transfer between disciplines and researchers is stressed.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a simulation study that evaluated the ICES scientific advisory process used to recommend total allowable catches (TACs) for flatfish stocks. Particular emphasis is given to examining the effects on stock biomass, yield and stability of constraining interannual variation in TACs. A “management strategy evaluation” approach is used where an operating model is used to represent the underlying reality, and pseudo data are generated for use within a management procedure. The management procedure comprises a stock assessment that uses data to estimate parameters of interest and a decision rule to derive TAC recommendations for the following year. Bounds on TAC of between 20\% and 40\% have little effect on yields or stability, while a 10\% bound on TAC can affect the ability to achieve management targets and result in low-frequency cycling in the stock. In the short term, performance is highly dependent on current stock status but bounds have less effect if the stock is close to equilibrium for a target fishing mortality (F). In addition, it was shown that current ICES biomass and fishing mortality reference points are not always consistent, and several are clearly inappropriate. Importantly, including realistic sources and levels of uncertainty can result in far from optimal management outcomes based on the current procedures. Results also conflicted with expert opinion, in suggesting that management based on a fixed F regime could result in relatively stable yields despite fluctuations in year-class strength and that the management feedback process itself is implicated in causing fluctuations in the system due to significant time-lags in this process. We therefore emphasize that providing more precise population estimates or developing harvest control rules alone will not necessarily help in achieving management objectives, rather management procedures that are robust to uncertainty and tuned to meet management objectives need to be developed. Operating models in these simulations were constrained to be based on existing ICES methods and perceptions of stock dynamics, but we recommend that, in future, operating models that represent the best available understanding of the actual system dynamics be used to evaluate models and rules considered for application.},

	abstract = {Modern fisheries research and management must understand and take account of the interactions between climate and fishing, rather than try to disentangle their effects and address each separately. These interactions are significant drivers of change in exploited marine systems and have ramifications for ecosystems and those who depend on the services they provide. We discuss how fishing and climate forcing interact on individual fish, marine populations, marine communities, and ecosystems to bring these levels into states that are more sensitive to (i.e. more strongly related with) climate forcing. Fishing is unlikely to alter the sensitivities of individual finfish and invertebrates to climate forcing. It will remove individuals with specific characteristics from the gene pool, thereby affecting structure and function at higher levels of organisation. Fishing leads to a loss of older age classes, spatial contraction, loss of sub-units, and alteration of life history traits in populations, making them more sensitive to climate variability at interannual to interdecadal scales. Fishing reduces the mean size of individuals and mean trophic level of communities, decreasing their turnover time leading them to track environmental variability more closely. Marine ecosystems under intense exploitation evolve towards stronger bottom–up control and greater sensitivity to climate forcing. Because climate change occurs slowly, its effects are not likely to have immediate impacts on marine systems but will be manifest as the accumulation of the interactions between fishing and climate variability — unless threshold limits are exceeded. Marine resource managers need to develop approaches which maintain the resilience of individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems to the combined and interacting effects of climate and fishing. Overall, a less-heavily fished marine system, and one which shifts the focus from individual species to functional groups and fish communities, is likely to provide more stable catches with climate variability and change than would a heavily fished system.},

	abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well–documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open–access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year–round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top–down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment.
An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non–equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources.
The new management framework requires co–management and collective decision–making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre–negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision–making occurs in conditions of model–based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model–based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non–discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non–discretionary recovery plans should then override rights–based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre–established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime.
In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime–induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time– and area–specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore.
More fundamentally, the basic axiom of ‘enlightened self interest’ underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

Catch-pooling cooperatives are a strategy for fishers to manage variability which can be organized independently of a central management agency. We examined the statistical properties of equal-share catch-pooling cooperatives, and tested their potential to mitigate risk using data from two Bering Sea crab fisheries prior to rationalization. The results suggest that small cooperatives of crabbers could have reduced vessel-level catch risk by as much as 40\% in the red king crab fishery, but would have been ineffective in the snow crab fishery. Analytical examination of catch variances under cooperatives explains the discrepancy between the two fisheries and demonstrates that variability reduction depends on the degree of correlation amongst participants' catches. In the best-case scenario, catch-pooling cooperatives can diversify away all season to season variation resulting from individuals' luck and skill, leaving only variation in fishery-wide harvest.},

	abstract = {European hake (Merluccius merluccius) were caught alive in the northern Bay of Biscay in June/July 2002, using a codend specially designed to avoid crushing fish and also to retain water while hauling the trawl. In all, 1307 fish were tagged with anchor T-bar tags, injected with tetracycline, then released. The length range of the tagged and marked fish varied from 13 to 58 cm, and the modal size was 28 cm, at which length they were assumed to be 2–3 years old. A mean survival rate of 68.2\% was estimated. Mortality was mainly caused by stress of capture and physical damage, and depended on the size of the catch and the depth of trawling. By the end of March 2003, 32 fish and three tags had been returned to the laboratory (a 2.7\% return rate), the recapture data indicating that the probability of survival after release does not depend on catch depth or depth at location of release. For combined sexes, the somatic growth rate was estimated at 0.033 ± 0.019 cm day−1 (n=15). Males and females did not differ significantly in somatic growth rate, which were, respectively, 0.028±0.018 (n=6) and 0.033 ± 0.012 cm day−1 (n=6). This pilot experiment represents the first recorded mass tagging of European hake, which is known to be a very fragile species. The preliminary results indicate that it would be possible to carry out a large-scale tagging experiment of the European stocks in order to improve assessment and subsequent management decisions.},

	abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed strong declines in fish stocks around the globe, amid growing concerns about the impact of fisheries on marine and freshwater biodiversity. Fisheries biologists and managers are therefore increasingly asking about aspects of ecology, behaviour, evolution and biodiversity that were traditionally studied by people working in very separate fields. This has highlighted the need to work more closely together, in order to help ensure future success both in management and conservation.The Handbook of Fish Biology and Fisheries has been written by an international team of scientists and practitioners, to provide an overview of the biology of freshwater and marine fish species together with the science that supports fisheries management and conservation. This volume, subtitled Fisheries, focuses on a wide range of topics, including the history of fisheries science, methods of capture, marketing, economics, major models used in stock assessments and forecasting, ecosystem impacts, marine protected areas and conservation. It builds on material in Volume 1, Fish Biology, which ranges from phylogenetics and biogeography to physiology, recruitment, life histories, genetics, foraging, reproductive behaviour and community ecology. Together, these books present the state of the art in our understanding of fish biology and fisheries and will serve as valuable references for undergraduates and graduates looking for a comprehensive source on a wide variety of topics in fisheries science. They will also be useful to researchers who need up-to-date reviews of topics that impinge on their fields, and decision makers who need to appreciate the scientific background for management and conservation of aquatic ecosystems.To order volume II, go to the box in the top right hand corner.

	abstract = {Individual growth is one of the main processes which drive the population dynamic and stock productivity. Many fish have differential individual growth by sex. Growth is affected by sexual development, which is frequently reached at different sizes in males and females. Differences in growth per sex after maturity produce different patterns in sex proportions-at-length in the population. If these patterns are the consequence of changes in life history parameters, sex ratio-at-length data can be expected to contain significant information on the population life history. In this paper I first explore how post-maturity changes in life history may shape these patterns in sex ratio-at-length; secondly I explore how these data may be used to estimate growth parameters and finally I discuss how this information may be useful for stock assessment purposes. I use European hake data and life history parameters to model expected sex ratios. The results suggest that reproductive energy allocation leads to a lower growth rate in male hakes than in females. Moreover the sex ratio-at-length may provide useful information for estimating growth parameters in dimorphic species if additional information from other sources is available. Finally, these data can easily be factored into stock assessment models to help provide a better estimation of growth parameters and mortality rates. This valuable, accurate and cheap biological information (sex ratio-at-length) may play an important role in population dynamic models and stock assessment for species with sexual size dimorphism.},

	abstract = {An age-length structured model was built for European hake Merluccius merluccius in the central Mediterranean Sea using Gadget. This analytical framework allowed to integrate multiple sources of information, including fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent data, collected at different scales and aggregation levels. The model includes the two main fisheries targeting hake in the area, the trawl and the gillnet fisheries, and account for differences in their selectivity and effort. Alternative models were used for testing different assumptions on recruitment and growth. The model is then used to predict the main trajectory of the stock during the next years and to evaluate the potential effects of implementing closed areas management scenarios in the hake nurseries as a specific tool to reduce fishing mortality on recruits. The modelling framework presented performed successfully also in a commercial landing data limited context, common for the Mediterranean. Our results provide statistical support for fast growth and multiple recruitment events assumptions. Including both these key features represent an unprecedented improvement of modelling hake population dynamics in the Mediterranean. We found that the reduction in the fishing effort that characterized the fisheries in the study area during the last few years, coupled with fast recovery abilities of the hake stock, has the potentiality to allow a moderate increase of the stock during the next years. Interestingly, our simulations show that the positive effects which might be expected from protecting hake nursery grounds are only marginally related to a reduction in hake recruits fishing mortality. Although our model relies on assumptions and surely represents an over-simplification of the real world, it still contributed to improve our understanding of the temporal dynamics of one of the most valuable fish stocks in the central Mediterranean.},

Integration of biological, economic, and sociological knowledge by Bayesian belief networks: the interdisciplinary evaluation of potential management plans for Baltic salmon. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: . There is a growing need to evaluate fisheries management plans in a comprehensive interdisciplinary context involving stakeholders. The use of a probabilistic management model to evaluate potential management plans for Baltic salmon fisheries is demonstrated. The analysis draws on several scientific studies: a biological stock assessment with integrated economic analysis of the commercial fisheries, an evaluation of recreational fisheries, and a sociological study aimed at understanding stakeholder perspectives and potential commitment to alternative management plans. A Bayesian belief network is used to synthesize the findings from these separate studies and to evaluate the robustness of management decisions to different priorities and various sources of uncertainty. In particular, the importance of sociological studies in quantifying uncertainty about the commitment of fishers to management plans is highlighted by modelling the link between commitment and implementation success. Such analyses, relying on prior knowledge, can forewarn of the consequences of management choices before they are implemented.},

The latter may be particularly useful in the management of contentious fisheries, where different nations and interest groups may suggest alternative assessment models and management–each likely to imply different findings, even when using the same data. Such situations might be approached in a number of different ways. For example, one might attempt to choose a best model from all those available and to base decisions on it alone. Alternatively, one might make decisions that lead to acceptable outcomes under all envisaged models; or one could reach decisions that are good on average (where average is taken over the set of all competing models and is weighted by a measure of how well each model coheres with available information). This last approach is advocated in this paper, and a Bayesian technique for achieving it is presented and discussed. The main points of the paper are illustrated with a hypothetical application of the technique to the rebuilding of the biomass of haddock by a selective culling of seals.},

	abstract = {Humanity can make short work of the oceans’ creatures. In 1741, hungry explorers discovered herds of Steller’s sea cow in the Bering Strait, and in less than thirty years, the amiable beast had been harpooned into extinction. It’s a classic story, but a key fact is often omitted. Bering Island was the last redoubt of a species that had been decimated by hunting and habitat loss years before theexplorers set sail.  As Callum M. Roberts reveals in The Unnatural History of the Sea, the oceans’ bounty didn’t disappear overnight. While today’s fishing industry is ruthlessly efficient, intense exploitation began not in the modern era, or even with the dawn of industrialization, but in the eleventh century in medieval Europe. Roberts explores this long and colorful history of commercial fishing, taking readers around the world and through the centuries to witness the transformation of the seas. Drawing on firsthand accounts of early explorers, pirates, merchants, fishers, and travelers, the book recreates the oceans of the past: waters teeming with whales, sea lions, sea otters, turtles, and giant fish. The abundance of marine life described by fifteenth century seafarers is almost unimaginable today, but Roberts both brings it alive and artfully traces its depletion. Collapsing fisheries, he shows, are simply the latest chapter in a long history of unfettered commercialization of the seas.  The story does not end with an empty ocean. Instead, Roberts describes how we might restore the splendor and prosperity of the seas through smarter management of our resources and some simple restraint. From the coasts of Florida to New Zealand, marine reserves have fostered spectacular recovery of plants and animals to levels not seen in a century. They prove that history need not repeat itself: we can leave the oceans richer than we found them.},

The work is written from the authors s committed Bayesian perspective, but an overview of non-Bayesian theories is also provided, and each chapter contains a wide-ranging critical re-examination of controversial issues. The level of mathematics used is such that most material is accessible to readers with knowledge of advanced calculus. In particular, no knowledge of abstract measure theory is assumed, and the emphasis throughout is on statistical concepts rather than rigorous mathematics.

The software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu commands, through which the model may then be analysed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific applications that form an apparently seamless interface with WinBUGS for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface with WinBUGS at a lower level by incorporating new object types that may be used by WinBUGS without knowledge of the modules in which they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require access to, or even recompilation of, the WinBUGS source-code.},

Uncertainty is, however, pervasive and its characterization is essential if we are to understand our effects on ecosystems. Traditional fisheries management has a poor track record for confronting uncertainty, but most management authorities are now committed to a precautionary approach. As a result, some of the most interesting methods for taking account of uncertainty in ecological systems have been developed by fisheries scientists. These methods evaluate the relative performance of different management procedures with the use of mathematical and statistical models that synthesize knowledge and speculation about the system of interest. Recent advances in computer-intensive statistics have made it possible to combine this approach with model fitting, so that the uncertainties and risks associated with different outcomes of management can be quantified. We show how this methodology can be applied to a range of ecological problems where the advice that scientists provide to decision makers is likely to be clouded by uncertainty.},

Mark–recapture monitoring is a promising tool for this because of the increased popularity of catch-and-release angling. Northern pike, Esox lucius L., population sizes were estimated in four lakes based on experimental mark–recapture fishing using a hierarchical Bayesian model that also estimated natural mortality. The approach was compared with output from traditional Petersen’s population size estimates. Despite intensive fishing with multiple gears, the population size estimates suggested that a substantial proportion of individuals remained unobserved by fishing. Petersen’s estimates depended on the assumed rate of natural mortality, and no mortality rate scenario matched with the Bayesian estimates. Consequently, the number of individuals caught by recreational anglers is a poor proxy of population size for which estimations should be carried out using a modelling approach that also estimates natural mortality.},

We reviewed characteristics and approaches that contribute to successful global marine conservation efforts. One successful characteristic emphasized in most case studies is the importance of incorporating stakeholders at all phases of the process. Clearly defined goals and objectives at all stages of the design process are important for improved communication and standardized expectations of stakeholder groups. The inclusion of available science to guide the size and design of marine protected areas and to guide clear monitoring strategies that assess success at scientific, social, and economic levels is also an important tool in the process. Common shortcomings in marine conservation planning strategies include government instability and resultant limitations to monitoring and enforcement, particularly in developing nations. Transferring knowledge to local community members has also presented challenges in areas where in situ training, local capacity, and existing infrastructure are sparse. Inaccessible, unavailable, or outdated science is often a limitation to conservation projects in developed and developing nations. To develop and maintain successful marine protected areas, it is necessary to acknowledge that each case is unique, to apply tools and lessons learned from other marine protected areas, and to maintain flexibility to adjust to the individual circumstances of the case at hand.},

The potential use of a Gadget model to predict stock responses to climate change in combination with Bayesian networks: the case of Bay of Biscay anchovy. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1257–1269. The European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) is a short-lived pelagic species distributed in Atlantic European waters, with the Bay of Biscay being one of the main centres of abundance. Because it is a short-lived species, the state of the stock is determined largely by incoming recruitment. Recruitment is highly variable and depends on a variety of factors, such as the size of the spawning stock and environmental conditions in the area. The use of a coupled model that could serve to predict the evolution of the anchovy stock in the short, medium, and long term under several fishing-pressure scenarios and given climate scenarios is demonstrated. This coupled model consists of a Gadget (Globally Applicable Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox) model that was used to analyse the status of the Bay of Biscay anchovy population and to simulate future scenarios based on the estimated recruitment levels, combined with a probabilistic Bayesian network model for recruitment estimation based on machine-learning methods and using climatic indices as potential forecasting factors. The results indicate that certain combinations of medium to high fishing pressure and adverse environmental conditions could force the stock outside its biological reference boundaries.},

A biologically sensible age–length structured multispecies Gadget model (incorporating minke whales, cod, herring, and capelin) for the Barents Sea—acting as the operating model—has been linked to Fisheries Library in R—acting as the management procedure—to perform management strategy evaluations. Assessments may be run using either XSA, survey-based methods, or by taking modelled stock numbers directly. Total allowable catches are based on the assessment and harvest control rules (HCRs). The tool can be used for assessing a wide variety of sources of uncertainties within the assessment process. Model structure and linkages are described and a fit to the historical data is presented. A base case of future dynamic (non-steady state) stock trends, based on the existing HCRs, is compared with alternative management and environmental scenarios. The relative differences for each scenario in terms of stock size and catches highlight a number of uncertainties within the biological and fisheries system. The results indicate that the current management rules are robust to the range of scenarios examined so far.},

Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a tool that has been widely used to develop and test single species fisheries management strategies and is now being extended to support ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM). We describe the application of MSE to investigate alternative strategies for achieving EBFM goals for a complex multispecies fishery in southeastern Australia. The study was undertaken as part of a stakeholder driven process to review and improve the ecological, economic and social performance of the fishery. An integrated management strategy, involving combinations of measures including quotas, gear controls and spatial management, performed best against a wide range of objectives and this strategy was subsequently adopted in the fishery, leading to marked improvements in performance. Although particular to one fishery, the conclusion that an integrated package of measures outperforms single focus measures we argue is likely to apply widely in fisheries that aim to achieve EBFM goals.},

These three species contribute a considerable part of Scottish demersal landings from this area and as such it is important to understand why these stocks are behaving the way they are. A number of explanations for the decline have been proposed, including: seal predation, pressure from Nephrops trawls, and fishing pressure more generally. We used an ecosystem model of the wcoS continental shelf ({\textless}200 m depth) to investigate whether these proposed explanations for declining gadoid stocks are feasible. Results suggest that the rise in the grey seal population over recent years has not led to the decline in gadoid stocks; there is insufficient bycatch by the Nephrops fleet to have a large impact on gadoid stocks; however, fishing, as a key driver of the west of Scotland shelf ecosystem, has impacted stocks and by decreasing fishing levels to maximum sustainable yield cod biomass may increase slightly though not returning to previous levels. Although this means we are little further forward in understanding the cause of recent gadoid declines in the area, the development of this model has enabled us to further our knowledge and understanding of aspects of trophic structure and the impacts of fishing on the wcoS.},

Many fishery managers still perceive EAF as too difficult to implement, but for most fisheries it can be relatively simple, especially with the tools now available. Consequently, the FAO initiated development of an EAF Toolbox to provide improved access to knowledge of the EAF process and tools suitable for its implementation. This toolbox (www.fao.org/fishery/eaf-net) uses a web based, expert system designed to help a wide variety of fishery stakeholders better understand EAF and assist with the selection of the most appropriate set of tools for their situation. Using the toolbox makes implementing EAF technically feasible for all fisheries irrespective of their value or the level of resources and data, but impediments including insufficient institutional, stakeholder and political commitment may still affect its adoption in some locations.},

	abstract = {The economics of enforcement is traditionally modelled using rational agents assumed to act according to their expected economic utility. In this investigation we derive this expectation by implementing a stochastic simulation model to integrate across associated levels of uncertainty using Monte Carlo. The model is developed for the South Georgia toothfish longline fishery, in which legal catches are strictly managed according to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) conservation measures. Assuming full compliance in the legal fishery, this investigation deals with the role of a fishing patrol vessel (FPV) in excluding illegal fishing vessels. Both legal and illegal fleets are dynamic. For the legal fleet, catch is set by a harvest control rule within the model framework, with vessels leaving if fishing becomes unprofitable. The illegal catch is determined by the number of vessels operating, which predicts catch on the basis of an estimated production function. The exit of illegal vessels is determined by the probability of detection by the FPV, which is a function of days spent on patrol, and estimated profits. The entry of illegal vessels occurs at a fixed mean rate, with the model integrating over uncertainty in this parameter. An obvious trade off exists in that higher levels of illegal activity lead to lower expected returns to the legal fleet. We thus provide a cost-benefit framework for investigating the trade-offs associated with decisions on enforcement in the fishery, and confirm that current enforcement effort levels are well justified.},

Meteorological forcing related to heavy episodes of rainfall that affected river discharges and the wind regime, controlled both the currents along the shelf together and the nutrient concentrations of the surface waters. Meteorological forcing in turn determined the subsequent development and maintenance of phytoplankton blooms. Superimposed on the seasonal cycle typical of temperate latitudes, the inputs of continental nutrients mainly from the Guadalquivir River, along with episodes of upwelling favored by the predominance of westerly winds triggered phytoplankton growth on the shelf, highlighting the markedly relevant role of this large estuary in the control of the biological activity on the shelf.},

Under the hypothesis f=gf = g the probability of obtaining a given UU in a sample of nx′sn x's and my′sm y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving nn and mm. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of UU for samples up to n=m=8n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained.

The analysis differs from previous assessments by starting at an exploited population size in 1970 and using a Bayesian framework to describe uncertainty in the estimates of current stock status and projections of future stock status. The model was fit to two tagging biomass estimates and to catch‐at‐age data. Annual recruitment multipliers were estimated by assuming a temperature‐recruitment relationship and fitting to pre‐recruit trawl survey data for the Hauraki Gulf‐Bay of Plenty combined substock (HG‐BoP) and as individual parameters for the East Northland substock (EN). The combined HG‐BoP substock is estimated to be below the biomass level that will support maximum sustainable yield, but will rebuild under current estimated removals. The EN substock is estimated to be above the biomass level that will support maximum sustainable yield and will remain above this level during the next 20 years assuming current estimated removals continue. The initial fishing mortality rate in 1970 is a very important parameter in the model because it is inversely related to the rate of stock rebuilding. Unfortunately the initial fishing mortality rate is not well determined by the data in either assessment.},

This effect, also found to be occurring in inland fisheries, is most pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere.

One consequence is that the coefficient of variation (the relative variance) of the yield increases as the point of maximum sustained yield (MSY) is approached. When overexploitation has resulted in a population smaller than that for MSY, high effort produces a low average yield with high variance. These observations accord with observed trends in several fish and whaling industries. We expect these effects to be more pronounced for a harvesting strategy based on constant quotas than for one based on constant effort.

	abstract = {Coastal habitats that serve as nursery grounds for numerous marine species are badly degraded, yet the traditional means of modeling populations of exploited marine species handle spatiotemporal changes in habitat characteristics and life history dynamics poorly, if at all. To explore how nursery habitat degradation impacts recruitment of a mobile, benthic species, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based model that describes the recruitment of Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) in the Florida Keys, where a cascade of environmental disturbances has reconfigured nursery habitat structure. In recent years, the region has experienced a series of linked perturbations, among them, seagrass die-offs, cyanobacteria blooms, and the mass mortality of sponges. Sponges are important shelters for juvenile spiny lobster, an abundant benthic predator that also sustains Florida's most valuable fishery. In the model, we simulated monthly settlement of individual lobster postlarvae and the daily growth, mortality, shelter selection, and movement of individual juvenile lobsters on a spatially explicit grid of habitat cells configured to represent the Florida Keys coastal nursery. Based on field habitat surveys, cells were designated as either seagrass or hard-bottom, and hard-bottom cells were further characterized in terms of their shelter- and size-specific lobster carrying capacities. The effect of algal blooms on sponge mortality, hence lobster habitat structure, was modeled based on the duration of exposure of each habitat cell to the blooms. Ten-year simulations of lobster recruitment with and without algal blooms suggest that the lobster population should be surprisingly resilient to massive disturbances of this type. Data not used in model development showed that predictions of large changes in lobster shelter utilization, yet small effects on recruitment in response to blooms, were realistic. The potentially severe impacts of habitat loss on recruitment were averted by compensatory changes in habitat utilization and mobility by larger individuals, coupled with periods of fortuitously high larval settlement. Our model provides an underutilized approach for assessing habitat effects on open populations with complex life histories, and our results illustrate the potential pitfalls of relying on intuition to infer the effects of habitat perturbations on upper trophic levels.},

	abstract = {The meteorological and oceanographic factors that have clear influence on the distribution of Engraulis encrasicolus eggs and larvae in shelf waters of the northeastern sector of the Gulf of Cádiz has been analyzed. Very high concentrations of anchovy eggs and larvae were found in this area during the spawning period (from March 2002 to September of 2002). The shallowness of the water column, the influence of the Guadalquivir River, and the local topography favor the existence of warm and chlorophyll-rich waters in the area, thus offering a favorable environment for the development of eggs and larvae. However, during spring and early summer intense easterlies were observed to cause a decrease of the water temperature by several degrees. Easterlies generate oligotrophic conditions in the area, and their persistence forces the offshore transport of waters over this portion of the shelf, advecting early life stages away from favorable conditions. These negative influences on the development conditions of anchovy eggs and larvae can impact on the recruitment of this species in the Gulf of Cádiz. Therefore, inter-annual fluctuations in the duration of intense easterly winds is analyzed and discussed in connection with anchovy catches.},

	abstract = {Fisheries oceanography is largely an applied discipline with a major goal of improving fisheries management and marine conservation. Johan Hjort's critical period hypothesis, and its decedents, remain a dominant theme and focuses on year-class success as mediated by prey availability and feeding. Bottom-up forcing, a related hypothesis, focuses on the sequential transfer of energy through the pelagic foodweb from primary productivity to fishery productivity. Another approach assumes that trophic interactions of adults determine abundance. Fisheries assessment and management, however, is based on the hypothesis that fishery abundance is determined by time-varying fishing and year-class success related to spawning-stock biomass. These approaches, their basic hypotheses, and underlying processes and mechanisms suggest very different dynamics for fishery populations. Other hypotheses challenge these traditional views: predation of early life stages, parental condition, shifting migration pathways, and physiological limits. Support for these other hypotheses is reviewed and the research needs are described to apply these hypotheses to fisheries assessment and management. Some of these hypotheses were identified by Hjort (e.g. parental condition hypothesis) and others are relative new (e.g. early life stage predation hypothesis). Moving into the future, we should focus on Hjort's approach: multi-hypothesis, integrative, and interdisciplinary. A range of hypotheses should be pursued with an emphasis on comparing and linking multiple hypotheses. The results then must be incorporated into fishery assessments and management decisions to support the long-term sustainability of exploited species and the conservation of threatened and endangered species.},

Better reference points such as Fmed and Fhigh that take account of stock and recruit data cannot be used in developing fishery situations because they are too demanding of data. A simple model was fitted to medium-term (about 10 year) periods in exploited small pelagic fisheries, relating change in stock biomass to exploitation rate. Data from 28 stocks and 11 species were used. The fitted model was used to estimate likelihood of stock decrease at different exploitation rates. The pelagic stocks included in the model appeared to be in equilibrium for an exploitation rate F/Z=0.4, which may be used as a guideline for the appropriate exploitation of pelagic stocks.},

These include growing concerns about the environmental impacts of fisheries, the role of ecological interactions in determining population dynamics, and the incorporation of uncertainty and precautionary principles into management advice. The book draws upon examples from tropical, temperate and polar environments, and provides readers with a broad understanding of the biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries ecology and the interplay between them. As well as covering 'classical' fisheries science, the book focuses on contemporary issues such as industrial fishing, poverty and conflict in fishing communities, marine reserves, the effects of fishing on coral reefs and by-catches of mammals, seabirds and reptiles. The book is primarily written for students of fisheries science and marine ecology, but should also appeal to practicing fisheries scientists and those interested in conservation and the impacts of humans on the marine environment.  particularly useful are the modelling chapters which explain the difficult maths involved in a user-friendly manner describes fisheries exploitation, conservation and management in tropical, temperate and polar environments broad coverage of 'clasical' fisheries science emphasis on new approaches to fisheries science and the ecosystem effects of fishing examples based on the latest research and drawn from authors' international experience comprehensively referenced throughout extensively illustrated with photographs and line drawings},

	abstract = {The spatio-temporal distribution of the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in its early life stages was related to environmental conditions within the Guadalquivir River estuary (south-west, Spain) by monthly field surveys during nine periods of recruitment (May 1997 to December 2005). Anchovy post-larvae showed a consistent seasonal pattern of abundance throughout the study period: each year, a high anchovy recruitment period (HARP) occurred from late May to November, with a main peak in July, coinciding with the period when environmental conditions were more stable. Results of stepwise multiple regression analysis indicates that density of its main prey, Mesopodopsis slabberi, explained 45\% of total anchovy density variance. Furthermore, after removing the effect of this variable, interannual differences in the anchovy estuarine recruitment were not significant. Clear spatial and tidal trends were also observed for both prey and predator: at each sampling date, density decreased from the outer to inner estuary; at each sampling site, density was higher during ebbs than during floods. Field distributions related to environmental gradients during HARP indicated that the populations of E. encrasicolus and M. slabberi seemed to hold a steady position at a point on the salinity gradient by longitudinal displacement within the estuary. Since freshwater management actions affect the longitudinal position of the salinity gradient as well as the input of nutrients to the estuary and adjacent coastal areas, it is hypothesized that this factor may also be relevant to anchovy recruitment.},

	abstract = {The coastal upwelling region near Cape São Vicente, the southwestern tip of the Iberian Peninsula where the southern zonal coast meets the meridional western coast, was studied using over 1200 advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images of sea surface temperature and time series of sea level height, wind velocities, and nearshore sea surface temperature recorded at coastal sites within 200 km of the cape. Summer upwelling is more intense and persistent off the western coast than off the southern coast, where a recurrent warm coastal countercurrent flows westward, and at times turns northward along the western coast after reaching the cape. In this region the equatorward current jet of cold water upwelled off the western coast is no longer bounded by a coast. Three preferred directions for the spreading of this water are identified. The most persistent is eastward along the southern shelf break and slope, possibly merging with waters previously upwelled locally, which becomes separated from shore by the coastal progression of the warmer counterflow. The second preferred direction results in the southward development of a cold filament feature fed by cold waters upwelled farther north and represents the southernmost extent of the intense coastal upwelling jet, which overshoots the cape. The least frequent feature to develop is a cold filament that grows westward at the latitude of the cape, appearing to result from the meandering of the equatorward jet. The coastal countercurrent is seen to interact with the equatorward jet at times of relaxation, not only by separating the cold upwelled water from the coast but, when it is energetic enough, breaking westward offshore through the equatorward cold flow and separating the eastward and southward cold features from the upcoast cold waters. Empirical evidence shows the presence of an alongshore pressure gradient, stronger in summer, driving the coastal progression of the warm counterflow. Wind forcing plays an important role in the circulation by augmenting or diminishing the effect of the preexisting alongshore pressure gradients. The extent of the progression of the warm coastal countercurrent along the southern and western coast is dictated by the the strength of the upwelling favorable wind stress, which is able to balance and reverse the alongshore flow, at least in the upper layers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an experimental analysis of the salinity distribution, the salt balance, and the variation of the saline intrusion in comparison to the freshwater discharge in the Guadalquivir estuary, which is a mesotidal system regulated and normally subjected to extremely low river flows. In such low-flow conditions, it is positive, well-mixed, and tidally dominated. The estuary is also characterized by a nonstationary, effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient, whose probability density becomes increasingly narrower and whose mean value is higher further upstream. The tidal-averaged salt flux is controlled by the following mechanisms (in order of importance): the nontidal transport, the Stokes transport, and the tidal pumping induced by the covariance between the current and salinity. These three factors account for more than 98\% of the flux variation. In high river-flow conditions, the subtidal response and recovery of the estuary to changes in the river flow is analyzed. The increase in the tidal-averaged salinity during the first 2 weeks of the post-riverflood recovery in the middle and upper sections of the estuary is found to be linear in time. During that time, the celerity of the salt intrusion front was 4cm/s. The 2 psu isohaline salt intrusion X2 exhibits a complex dependence on the river flow Qd, including the effects of human interventions in the estuary. Three regimes are identified for the intrusion: X2=57.0± 2.1km for discharges of less than 20m 3/s, X2 proportional to Qd−0.428±0.016 between 20 and 1000m 3/s, and X2proportional to Qd−1.0±0.5for larger discharges.},

	abstract = {Aspects of the reproductive biology of the Bay of Cadiz anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus L., population have been studied from monthly samples taken from the Spanish purse-seine fishery during a four-year period (1989–1992). The spawning season extends from late winter to early autumn. The peak spawning time for the whole population occurs from June to August. However, larger anchovies (14–18.5 cm) are spring–summer spawners whereas anchovies in their first reproduction (11–13.5 cm) are mainly summer spawners. The sex ratio varies with size, females outnumbering males in the larger sizes. Annual sex ratios fulfill the theoretical 1:1 ratio, but vary seasonally. Maturity is attained at a total length of 11.09 cm in males and 11.20 cm in females. However, there are inter-annual variations in this size, suggesting a high plasticity in the reproductive characteristics as a response to the environmental factors regulating reproductive success. The seasonal cycle in anchovy condition appears to be related to both pulses in primary production and to the sexual cycle of the fish. Size-based differences in the energy investment in somatic growth and reproduction are suggested to explain the different reproductive patterns. The effects of a poor body condition in the anchovy ovary-weight cycle are discussed.},

	abstract = {The European anchovy fishery in the Gulf of Cádiz (ICES Division IXa South) is largely influenced by age-0 individuals. Knowledge of young of the year growth dynamics is crucial for management, yet data on daily growth are lacking in the area. Linking growth patterns to the environment requires information on habitat occupancy through ontogeny of the fish that reach the fishery, as anchovy use different areas of the Gulf and the Guadalquivir Estuary through development. We describe the growth dynamics of age-0 anchovy through otolith microstructure analysis, and couple these data with data on microchemical signals in the otoliths to shed light into habitat use and growth dynamics in the area. Age-0 anchovy captured in September, 2011 in the Gulf ranged from 3 to 6 months old for similar sizes, with average growth rates varying twofold. Individual non-linear growth curves showed that maximum otolith growth was positively correlated with the date of spawning, which in turn was negatively correlated with the time to reach maximum growth. There was no correlation between growth parameters and body length or condition (Fulton K) at capture. The strontium:calcium (Sr/Ca) and magnesium:calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios were significantly lower at the edge of the otolith (approximately the age of capture) than at ages corresponding to larval and early juveniles (\&lt;60 days old), but values fell within typical estuarine-dwelling species. The barium:calcium ratio (Ba/Ca) increased significantly in the edge of the otolith, which possibly resulted from residency in highly productive coastal waters or from ontogenetic effects. The variance in otolith elemental ratios was larger at otolith back-calculated ages around 50 days old, age which coincides with the presumed closer dependence of estuarine waters. Our data are a first step towards understanding the contribution of the estuarine system to the fishery of anchovy in the Gulf. The limitations of the approach and future steps are discussed.

Despite numerous attempts, the complexity of the problem often seems beyond the capabilities of traditional statistical analysis paradigms. This study examines the utility of four statistical procedures to identify relationships between recruitment and the environment. Because we can never really know the parameters or underlying relationships of actual data, we chose to use simulated data with known properties and different levels of measurement error to test and compare the methods, especially their ability to forecast future recruitment states. Methods examined include traditional linear regression, non-linear regression, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Each is compared according to its ability to recover known patterns and parameters from simulated data, as well as to accurately forecast future recruitment states. We also apply the methods to published Norwegian spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus L.) spawner–recruit–environment data. Results were not consistently conclusive, but in general, flexible non-parametric methods such as GAMs and ANNs performed better than parametric approaches in both parameter estimation and forecasting. Even under controlled data simulation procedures, we saw evidence of spurious correlations. Models fit to the Norwegian spring-spawning herring data show the importance of sea temperature and spawning biomass. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) did not appear to be an influential factor affecting herring recruitment.},

The development of a complex multispecies model requires understanding of the modelled single-species population. Simple single-species models are essential in evaluating whether more complex models increase understanding of the population dynamics. In this paper, Gadget is illustrated using a single-species case study with two stock components on one area. Features of the implementation include immature and mature stock components, a maturation process, along with commercial and survey fleets. Parameter estimation is done using maximum likelihood based on a variety of datasets. The estimated parameters relate to growth, maturation, fleet selection, recruitment and the initial population. The data types used to calculate the likelihood include survey indices and biological samples from the commercial catch and surveys. Optimisation of the model, along with a protocol to estimate appropriate weighting of the likelihood components, is described. A range of different assumptions and estimation methods are evaluated including the effect of reduced data availability on parameter estimation by excluding age data from the likelihood components.},

	abstract = {Summary.  Population dynamic modelling often entails parameterizing quite sophisticated biological and ecological mechanisms. For models of moderate mechanistic complexity, this has traditionally been done in an ad hoc manner, with different parameters being estimated independently. The point estimates so obtained are then used for model simulation, perhaps with some further ad hoc adjustment based on comparison with any available data on population dynamics. Quantitative assessments of model adequacy and prediction uncertainty are not easily made using this approach. As an alternative, the paper investigates the practical feasibility of fitting a moderately complex population dynamic model directly and simultaneously to all the data available for parameterization of the model, and to all available data on the population dynamics of the target animal. This alternative approach allows us to combine all available quantitative information on the target species, to assess the viability of the model, the mutual consistency of model and different sources of data and to estimate the uncertainties that are associated with model-based predictions. The target organism in this study is the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex (L.), which we model using a stage-structured population dynamic model, implemented via a set of delay differential equations describing the basic demography of the population. Target data include population dynamic data from two sites, information on basic physiological relationships and environmental temperature data. Fitting is performed by using a non-linear least squares approach supplemented with a bootstrapping method for avoiding small scale local minima in the least squares objective function. Variance estimation is performed by further bootstrapping. Interest in Gammarus pulex population dynamics in this case is primarily related to likely population level responses to chemical stressors, and for this we examine predicted ‘recovery times’ following exposure to a known toxicant.},

The value of information in fisheries management: North Sea herring as an example. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 000–000. We take a decision theoretical approach to fisheries management, using a Bayesian approach to integrate the uncertainty about stock dynamics and current stock status, and express management objectives in the form of a utility function. The value of new information, potentially resulting in new control measures, is high if the information is expected to help in differentiating between the expected consequences of alternative management actions. Conversely, the value of new information is low if there is already great certainty about the state and dynamics of the stock and/or if there is only a small difference between the utility attached to different potential outcomes of the alternative management action. The approach can, therefore, help when deciding on the allocation of resources between obtaining new information and improving management actions. In our example, we evaluate the value of obtaining hypothetically perfect knowledge of the type of stock–recruitment function of the North Sea herring (Clupea harengus) population.},

	abstract = {Anchovy population dynamics in the Gulf of Cádiz are governed by environmental processes. Sea surface temperature, intense easterly winds, and discharges from the Guadalquivir River have been identified as key factors determining early life stage mortality in this anchovy stock. We have constructed an environment-based recruitment model that simulates the abundance of juveniles under alternative parameters representing plausible biological hypotheses. We are able to evaluate how modelling environment-based recruitment can affect stock assessment and how responding to environmental information can beneﬁt ﬁshery management to allow greater average catch levels through the application of harvest control rules (HCRs) based on environmental conditions. While the environment-based rules generally increase allowable catch levels the variance in catch levels also increases, detracting from the improved value based only on average yield. In addition to changes in revenue, the probability of stock collapse is also reduced by using environmental factors in HCRs. To assess the value of these management systems we simulate a notional insurance scheme, which applies a value to both average yields and uncertainty. The value of the information-driven rules can be determined by comparing the relevant premiums payable for equal levels of insurance cover on revenue within each speciﬁc management regime. We demonstrate the net value of incorporating environmental factors in the management of anchovies in the Gulf of Cádiz despite the increased variability in revenue. This could be an effective method to describe outcomes for both commercial ﬁsheries and ecosystem management policies, and as a guide to management of other species whose dynamics are predictable based on in-season observations.},

	abstract = {Global methods based on variance decomposition are increasingly being used for sensitivity analysis (SA). Of these, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is surprisingly rarely employed. Yet, it is a viable alternative to other model-free methods, as it gives comparable results and is readily available in most statistical packages. Furthermore, decomposing the input factors of ANOVA into orthogonal polynomial effects gives additional insights into the way a parameter impacts on model output (linear, quadratic and cubic). However, using global methods should not lead modellers to forego local methods, which provide additional information, as, for example, time course analysis of local sensitivity coefficients. We illustrate the use of these techniques, particularly ANOVA, on a stochastic individual-based model of a mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) population in experimental tanks. Local SA led to unexpected and counter-intuitive results, indicating that the model output (population size) was much more sensitive to the fecundity threshold (length at first parturition) than to the fecundity parameter (brood size). Time course analysis of local coefficients suggested that, as far as calibration is concerned, it would probably be impossible to determine more than two parameters on the sole records of the population size in time. Global SA (ANOVA) was targeted to assess which processes had an impact on the model outcome in our experimental conditions, by exploring the parameter space over the entire biological range of all parameters. It showed that parameters had mainly linear and additive effects (few interactions) on the output in a logarithmic scale, and that the main processes involved in population growth were individual growth and adult survival, followed by the breeding process. Juvenile survival had a lesser impact.},

Testing different methods of incorporating climate data into the assessment of US West Coast sablefish. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1605–1613.The objective of this investigation was to evaluate different methods of including environmental variability directly into stock assessments and to demonstrate how this inclusion affects the estimation of recruitment parameters, stock status, and the conservation benchmarks used to manage a stock. Variations on two methods of incorporating environmental effects were tested. The first method (“model” method) utilizes a structural change in the stock–recruitment function to adjust the annual expected number of recruits by a value, either positive or negative, equal to that year's anomaly in the environmental variable. The second method (“data” method) allows for observation error in the environmental data and uses the time-series as an index to tune the vector of estimates of annual recruitment deviations. Simulation techniques were utilized to produce datasets of known quantities that were subsequently analysed with a widely used stock assessment platform. Under the circumstances simulated in this study, neither method could be said to have performed significantly better than the other in all situations. Because the two approaches handle years of missing data differently, the best approach is dictated by the available data, rather than a more appropriate method.},

	abstract = {Fish stock productivity, and thereby sensitivity to harvesting, depends on physical (e.g. ocean climate) and biological (e.g. prey availability, competition and predation) processes in the ecosystem. The combined impacts of such ecosystem processes and fisheries have lead to stock collapses across the world. While traditional fisheries management focuses on harvest rates and stock biomass, incorporating the impacts of such ecosystem processes are one of the main pillars of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Although EAFM has been formally adopted widely since the 1990s, little is currently known to what extent ecosystem drivers of fish stock productivity are actually implemented in fisheries management. Based on worldwide review of more than 1200 marine fish stocks, we found that such ecosystem drivers were implemented in the tactical management of only 24 stocks. Most of these cases were in the North Atlantic and north-east Pacific, where the scientific support is strong. However, the diversity of ecosystem drivers implemented, and in the approaches taken, suggests that implementation is largely a bottom-up process driven by a few dedicated experts. Our results demonstrate that tactical fisheries management is still predominantly single-species oriented taking little account of ecosystem processes, implicitly ignoring that fish stock production is dependent on the physical and biological conditions of the ecosystem. Thus, while the ecosystem approach is highlighted in policy, key aspects of it tend yet not to be implemented in actual fisheries management.},

We developed an ecosystem-specific, multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41\%) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research.
A meta-analysis shows that human activities have altered virtually all ocean ecosystems, at least to some extent, documenting those areas needing the most protection.

	abstract = {Time series analyses (Box–Jenkins models) were used to study the influence of river runoff and wind mixing index on the productivity of the two most abundant species of small pelagic fish exploited in waters surrounding the Ebre (Ebro) River continental shelf (north-western Mediterranean): anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus). River flow and wind were selected because they are known to enhance fertilization and local planktonic production, thus being crucial for the survival of fish larvae. Time series of the two environmental variables and landings of the two species were analysed to extract the trend and seasonality. All series displayed important seasonal and interannual fluctuations. In the long term, landings of anchovy declined while those of sardine increased. At the seasonal scale, landings of anchovy peaked during spring/summer while those of sardine peaked during spring and autumn. Seasonality in landings of anchovy was stronger than in sardine. Concerning the environmental series, monthly average Ebre runoff showed a progressive decline from 1960 until the late 1980s, and the wind mixing index was highest during 1994–96. Within the annual cycle, the minimum river flow occurs from July to October and the wind mixing peaks in winter (December–April, excluding January). The results of the analyses showed a significant correlation between monthly landings of anchovy and freshwater input of the Ebre River during the spawning season of this species (April–August), with a time lag of 12 months. In contrast, monthly landings of sardine were significantly positively correlated with the wind mixing index during the spawning season of this species (November–March), with a lag of 18 months. The results provide evidence of the influence of riverine inputs and wind mixing on the productivity of small pelagic fish in the north-western Mediterranean. The time lags obtained in the relationships stress the importance of river runoff and wind mixing for the early stages of anchovy and sardine, respectively, and their impact on recruitment.},

	abstract = {Fisheries catches represent a net export of mass and energy that can no longer be used by trophic levels higher than those fished. Thus, exploitation implies a depletion of secondary production of higher trophic levels (here the production of mass and energy by herbivores and carnivores in the ecosystem) due to the removal of prey. The depletion of secondary production due to the export of biomass and energy through catches was recently formulated as a proxy for evaluating the ecosystem impacts of fishing–i.e., the level of ecosystem overfishing. Here we evaluate the historical and current risk of ecosystem overfishing at a global scale by quantifying the depletion of secondary production using the best available fisheries and ecological data (i.e., catch and primary production). Our results highlight an increasing trend in the number of unsustainable fisheries (i.e., an increase in the risk of ecosystem overfishing) from the 1950s to the 2000s, and illustrate the worldwide geographic expansion of overfishing. These results enable to assess when and where fishing became unsustainable at the ecosystem level. At present, total catch per capita from Large Marine Ecosystems is at least twice the value estimated to ensure fishing at moderate sustainable levels.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT.  I trace the development of fisheries models (i.e., fish population dynamics models of species subject to fisheries) to the 21st century. The first real efforts occurred in the period 1900 1920 with the work of Baranov (the “Grandfather” of fisheries population dynamics) and the formation of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The establishment of the science occurred between 1920 1960 with multi-species modeling, age- and size-structure dynamics, and production models. Fundamental work during this time was done by Ricker (the “Father” of fisheries population dynamics), Beverton and Holt (the “Prophets” of fisheries population dynamics), Chapman, Dickie, DeLury, Graham, Gulland, Leslie, Lotka and Volterra, Russell, Schaefer, and Thompson. During this time, most of the workwas deterministic and mathematical. Between 1960 and 1980, statistical methodology evolved greatly but was separate from mathematical advances for the most part. The development of statistical principles for the estimation of animal abundance was further enhanced by Arnason, Buckland, Burnham and Anderson and White, Cormack, Eberhardt, Jolly, Manly, Pollock, Ricker, Robson, and Seber, among others. Fisheries models evolved in a deterministic setting, with advances in age-structured models (Gulland, Pope, Doubleday), surplus production models (Pella, Tomlin-son, Schnute, Fletcher, Hilborn), growth models, bioeconomic models (C. Clark) and management control models (Hilborn, Walters). The period 1980 2000 was the Golden Age. The integration between mathematics and statistics occurred when likelihood and least squares techniques were formally combined with mathematical models of population change. The number of fisheries modelers grew exponentially during this time, resulting in a concomitant increase in publications. A major advance in the 1990s has been the development of Bayesian and time series methods, which have allowed explicit specification of uncertainty. Currently, theory allows realistic modeling of age- and size-structured populations, migratory populations and harvesting strategies. These models routinely incorporate measurement error, process error (stochasticity) and time variation. But data needs often overwhelm the performance of models, and greater demands are being placed on models to answer complex questions. There has been poor communication between fisheries and ecological modelers, between fisheries researchers and statisticians, and among fisheries researchers in different geographic locales. Future models will need to deal better with habitat and spatial concerns, genetics, multispecies interactions, environmental factors, effects of harvesting on the ecosystem, model misspecification and so-cioeconomic concerns. Meta-analysis, retrospective analysis and operating models are some modern approaches for dealing with uncertainty and providing for sustainable fisheries. However, I fear that current attacks on single-species models and management may result in rejection of these advances and an attempt to substitute a less scientific approach.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are complex and dynamic natural units that produce goods and services beyond those of benefit to fisheries. Because fisheries have a direct impact on the ecosystem, which is also impacted by other human activities, they need to be managed in an ecosystem context. The meaning of the terms 'ecosystem management', 'ecosystem based management', 'ecosystem approach to fisheries'(EAF), etc., are still not universally defined and progressively evolving. The justification of EAF is evident in the characteristics of an exploited ecosystem and the impacts resulting from fisheries and other activities. The rich set of international agreements of relevance to EAF contains a large number of principles and conceptual objectives. Both provide a fundamental guidance and a significant challenge for the implementation of EAF. The available international instruments also provide the institutional foundations for EAF. The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries is particularly important in this respect and contains provisions for practically all aspects of the approach. One major difficulty in defining EAF lies precisely in turning the available concepts and principles into operational objectives from which an EAF management plan would more easily be developed. The paper discusses these together with the types of action needed to achieve them. Experience in EAF implementation is still limited but some issues are already apparent, e.g. in added complexity, insufficient capacity, slow implementation, need for a pragmatic approach, etc. It is argued, in conclusion, that the future of EAF and fisheries depends on the way in which the two fundamental concepts of fisheries management and ecosystem management, and their respective stakeholders, will join efforts or collide.},

We can apply a usual lag selection procedure to a possibly integrated or cointegrated VAR since the standard asymptotic theory is valid (as far as the order of integration of the process does not exceed the true lag length of the model). Having determined a lag length k, we then estimate a (k + dmax)th-order VAR where dmax is the maximal order of integration that we suspect might occur in the process. The coefficient matrices of the last dmax lagged vectors in the model are ignored (since these are regarded as zeros), and we can test linear or nonlinear restrictions on the first k coefficient matrices using the standard asymptotic theory.},

Code must be available to be distributed, data must be accessible in a readable format, and a platform must be available for widely distributing the data and code. In addition, both data and code need to be licensed permissively enough so that others can reproduce the work without a substantial legal burden. Implementing Reproducible Research covers many of the elements necessary for conducting and distributing reproducible research. It explains how to accurately reproduce a scientific result.   Divided into three parts, the book discusses the tools, practices, and dissemination platforms for ensuring reproducibility in computational science. It describes:   Computational tools, such as Sweave, knitr, VisTrails, Sumatra, CDE, and the Declaratron system Open source practices, good programming practices, trends in open science, and the role of cloud computing in reproducible research Software and methodological platforms, including open source software packages, RunMyCode platform, and open access journals  Each part presents contributions from leaders who have developed software and other products that have advanced the field.

	abstract = {The Barents Sea ecosystem, one of the most productive and commercially important ecosystems in the world, has experienced major fluctuations in species abundance the past five decades. Likely causes are natural variability, climate change, overfishing and predator–prey interactions. In this study, we use an age-length structured multi-species model (Gadget, Globally applicable Area-Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox) to analyse the historic population dynamics of major fish and marine mammal species in the Barents Sea. The model was used to examine possible effects of a number of plausible biological and fisheries scenarios. The results suggest that changes in cod mortality from fishing or cod cannibalism levels have the largest effect on the ecosystem, while changes to the capelin fishery have had only minor effects. Alternate whale migration scenarios had only a moderate impact on the modelled ecosystem. Indirect effects are seen to be important, with cod fishing pressure, cod cannibalism and whale predation on cod having an indirect impact on capelin, emphasising the importance of multi-species modelling in understanding and managing ecosystems. Models such as the one presented here provide one step towards an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.},

Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

For stock–recruitment models, the bias is misleading for management: the stock will appear too productive when it is low, and too unproductive when it is large. The likely magnitude of such biases can and should be determined for any particular case by Monte Carlo simulations., Les relations fonctionnelles, comme celles des courbes stock–recrutement, sont généralement estimées à partir de données de séries chronologiques où des facteurs naturels « aléatoires » ont provoqué une distorsion de la relation et une variation informative des variables indépendantes. Même en l'absence d'erreurs de mesures, ces expériences naturelles peuvent être source d'une distorsion importante des estimations de paramètres. Dans le cas des modèles stock–recrutement, le biais est source d'erreur de gestion : le stock apparaît trop productif quand il est peu important et trop peu productif quand il est important. L'importance probable de ce genre biais peut et doit être déterminée dans chaque cas par simulations de Monte-Carlo.},

	abstract = {The stock–recruitment relationship (SRR) and the recruitment to spawning stock relationship (RSR) of the tiger prawn (Penaeus esculentus) in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, were used to examine the time series bias and measurement error bias by Monte Carlo simulations. The bias of the SRR parameters was decreased by adding environmental variables which reduced the variation about the SRR. However, because of the many variables which may be tested and the short time series of data usually available, one needs to be careful about possible spurious correlations. The variation about the RSR also needs to be taken into account, since it has an inverse relationship with the bias in the SRR. Simulating the effect of measurement error as well as the random variation about the SRR and RSR helps to determine the possible combinations of measurement error and random variation which may result in the observed variation about the SRR and RSR. These simulations also indicate that there is an interaction between measur..., Les relations stock–recrutement (RSR) et recrutement–stock de reproducteurs (RRS) chez Penaeus esculentus dans le golfe d'Exmouth (ouest de l'Australie) ont été utilisées pour étudier les erreurs de séries chronologies et les erreurs de mesure par simulations Monte Carlo. Les erreurs des paramètres de la RSR ont été réduites par l'addition de variables environnementales qui ont diminué la variation autour de la RSR. Cependant, à cause du grand nombre de variables qui peuvent être testées et de la durée généralement courte des séries, il faut être conscient du fait que les corrélations peuvent être fausses. Il faut aussi tenir compte de la variation autour de la RRS puisque celle-ci est en relation inverse avec l'erreur sur la RSR. La simulation des effets de l'erreur de mesure ainsi que de la variation aléatoire autour de la RSR et de la RRS a aidé à déterminer des combinaisons d'erreur de mesure et de variations aléatoires susceptibles de produire la variation observée autour de la RSR et de la RRS.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT.  It is generally acknowledged that models of population dynamics need to include realistic biological and statistical assumptions if they are to be of any use. The “realistic” complexity of these models is defined not only by the underlying biology but also by what the available data can reasonably determine. As complexity increases through inclusion of interactions, new issues arise which need to be resolved before these complex models can be reliably applied. Specific issues in new models for management include proper statistical fitting to the data and incorporation of time-dependent and spatially explicit biological interactions. These current problem issues are presented in this paper and some potential solutions are discussed.},
