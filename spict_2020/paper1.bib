abstract = {Abstract Surplus production modelling has a long history as a method for managing data-limited fish stocks. Recent advancements have cast surplus production models as state-space models that separate random variability of stock dynamics from error in observed indices of biomass. We present a stochastic surplus production model in continuous time (SPiCT), which in addition to stock dynamics also models the dynamics of the fisheries. This enables error in the catch process to be reflected in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters and management quantities. Benefits of the continuous-time state-space model formulation include the ability to provide estimates of exploitable biomass and fishing mortality at any point in time from data sampled at arbitrary and possibly irregular intervals. We show in a simulation that the ability to analyse subannual data can increase the effective sample size and improve estimation of reference points relative to discrete-time analysis of aggregated annual data. Finally, subannual data from five North Sea stocks are analysed with particular focus on using residual analysis to diagnose model insufficiencies and identify necessary model extensions such as robust estimation and incorporation of seasonality. We argue that including all known sources of uncertainty, propagation of that uncertainty to reference points and checking of model assumptions using residuals are critical prerequisites to rigorous fish stock management based on surplus production models.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {We describe an information-theoretic paradigm for analysis of ecological data, based on {Kullback\&\#8211;Leibler} information, that is an extension of likelihood theory and avoids the pitfalls of null hypothesis testing. Information-theoretic approaches emphasise a deliberate focus on the \textit{a priori} science in developing a set of multiple working hypotheses or models. Simple methods then allow these hypotheses (models) to be ranked from best to worst and scaled to reflect a strength of evidence using the likelihood of each model ({\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{i}}$), given the data and the models in the set (i.e. {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}/i{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}/i{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{i}}$ \&\#124; {\textless}i{\textgreater}data{\textless}/i{\textgreater})). In addition, a variance component due to model-selection uncertainty is included in estimates of precision. There are many cases where formal inference 
can be based on all the models in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/i{\textgreater} set and this multi-model inference represents a powerful, new approach to valid inference. Finally, we strongly recommend inferences based on {\textless}i{\textgreater}a priori{\textless}/i{\textgreater} considerations be carefully separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging. An example is given for questions related to age- and sex-dependent rates of tag loss in elephant seals ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Mirounga leonina{\textless}/i{\textgreater}).},

	volume = {1},
	shorttitle = {Death rates and time intervals},
	doi = {10.1007/BF00157581},
	abstract = {The ‘constant M axiom’ refers to the often automatic assumption made in fish stock assessment, that the instantaneous natural mortality rate, expressed on an annual basis, is constant throughout the exploited phase of the life history. This uncritical assumption or axiom has come under criticism in recent years, best documented by field determinations of predation rates on juvenile fish coordinated in the North Sea through the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ({ICES).} These, and earlier studies, have yielded empirical vectors of predation-related M for juveniles of key species, and in some cases, also for egg and larval stages. To date, perhaps the mathematical function with the widest acceptance for modelling M-at-age in the animal kingdom has been the Weibull distribution. This paper attempts to demonstrate, for a limited sample of highly fecund marine organisms, that a simple, two-parameter reciprocal function of age is a more reasonable, and mathematically parsimonious, 
description of the form of the life history M-vector between egg and larval stages and the mean parental age ({MPA).} Mortality rates may increase later in life, especially for semelparous species, and in this case would need to be described by an additional or more complex function, beyond the scope of this paper. Seasonal and inter-annual variations in M-at-age, though rarely documented, also occur; in the latter case, when associated with density dependence, they give rise to the stock-recruit relationships described in the literature, and lead to annual divergences from mean expectation of death, especially for the earliest life-history stages. Contrary to preconception, however, there seems no overwhelming evidence from egg and larval studies for the consistent action of a critical period: the very high egg and larval M-at-age values predicted by the reciprocal function, though continuous in time, effectively correspond to catastrophic early mortality rates, but provide a mean expectation of death with 
age that converges smoothly on a constant M value at greater ages. The use of any steeply declining mortality function of age, in simulating survivorship over a time period T between spawning and maturity of the succeeding generation, reveals a serious difficulty in defining appropriate time units. It is concluded that if the reciprocal mortality function applies, then simulating constant survivors at time T independently of the number of smaller time units (Δt) that T is divided into, is effectively accomplished by using progressively longer time intervals with age t, such that Δt/t is constant for all intervals. This is referred to as ‘proportional time allocation’. Calculations assuming population stability, and using indicative values for mean lifetime fecundity ({MLF)} and mean parental age ({MPA)}, are presented for a generalized demersal and a generalized small pelagic fish, employing the reciprocal function with proportional time allocation. Sets of values for the two parameters of the reciprocal 
function were not rejected, even though non-unique, if they reduced the {MLF} to two individuals by {MPA}, and a unique vector of M-at-age presumably could be determined if the ‘constant adult M’ is already known. The new model has the advantage of being compatible with the ‘constant adult M’ hypothesis over periods of roughly 4–5 and 1+ years, respectively, for generalized northern demersals and small pelagics, over the ages just preceding {MPA.} The possibility of extension of this model to length-based methods, and its analogies with crustacean moulting models, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Since the late 1980s, the Daily Egg Production Method ({DEPM)} has been applied to several anchovy stocks in European waters. {DEPM} surveys in the Bay of Biscay were well standardized and focused on providing fisheries-independent information for stock assessment purposes. Those targeting Mediterranean stocks were largely experimental and often opportunistic, with the main aim of developing and testing the method, rather than providing estimates of spawning stock biomass ({SSB)} for stock assessment. Consequently, the {DEPM} has been applied once, twice, or a maximum of three times in certain Mediterranean areas with no among-area standardization. Different techniques for several aspects of the method have been used in the Mediterranean, and the parameters estimated vary greatly among stocks and year of application. Evidence is provided that variability in biological production among sub-basins and/or years, a characteristic of Mediterranean Sea, may directly affect anchovy egg production. The 
daily specific fecundity of anchovy stocks can vary greatly among years, areas, or seasons in response to changing environmental and trophic regimes. When the correlation between regression-derived estimates of daily egg production and associated estimates of daily specific fecundity for anchovy in the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, and upwelling areas are compared, a significant isometric relationship emerges for the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay, implying density-dependent use of spawning habitat. In upwelling areas, estimates of daily egg production are relatively high for a narrow range of generally low daily specific fecundities. There is a strong linear relationship between anchovy {SSB} and spawning area in European waters that does not differ significantly between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean Sea.},

	abstract = {Geographic surveys of allozymes, microsatellites, nuclear {DNA} ({nDNA)} and mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA)} have detected several genetic subdivisions among European anchovy populations. However, these studies have been limited in their power to detect some aspects of population structure by the use of a single or a few molecular markers, or by limited geographic sampling. We use a multi-marker approach, 47 {nDNA} and 15 {mtDNA} single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs)}, to analyze 626 European anchovies from the whole range of the species to resolve shallow and deep levels of population structure. Nuclear {SNPs} define 10 genetic entities within two larger genetically distinctive groups associated with oceanic variables and different life-history traits. {MtDNA} {SNPs} define two deep phylogroups that reflect ancient dispersals and colonizations. These markers define two ecological groups. One major group of Iberian-Atlantic populations is associated with upwelling areas on narrow continental 
shelves and includes populations spawning and overwintering in coastal areas. A second major group includes northern populations in the North East ({NE)} Atlantic (including the Bay of Biscay) and the Mediterranean and is associated with wide continental shelves with local larval retention currents. This group tends to spawn and overwinter in oceanic areas. These two groups encompass ten populations that differ from previously defined management stocks in the Alboran Sea, Iberian-Atlantic and Bay of Biscay regions. In addition, a new North Sea-English Channel stock is defined. {SNPs} indicate that some populations in the Bay of Biscay are genetically closer to North Western ({NW)} Mediterranean populations than to other populations in the {NE} Atlantic, likely due to colonizations of the Bay of Biscay and {NW} Mediterranean by migrants from a common ancestral population. Northern {NE} Atlantic populations were subsequently established by migrants from the Bay of Biscay. Populations along the Iberian-Atlantic 
coast appear to have been founded by secondary waves of migrants from a southern refuge.},

	OPTabstract = {Gonosomatic indices and egg and larval densities observed from 1986 to 2001 suggest that the peak spawning season of the Australian anchovy {(Engraulis} australis) in South Australia occurs during January to March (summer and autumn). This coincides with the spawning season of sardine {(Sardinops} sagax) and the period when productivity in shelf waters is enhanced by upwelling. Anchovy eggs were abundant throughout gulf and shelf waters, but the highest densities occurred in the northern parts of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent where sea surface temperatures {(SST)} were {24–26°C.} In contrast, larvae {\textgreater}10 mm total length {(TL)} were found mainly in shelf waters near upwelling zones where {SSTs} were relatively low {({\textless}20°C)} and levels of chlorophyll a (chl a) relatively high. Larvae {\textgreater}15 mm {TL} were collected only from shelf waters near upwelling zones. The high levels of larval abundance in the upwelling zones may reflect higher levels of recruitment to 
later stages in these areas compared with the gulfs. The sardine spawns mainly in shelf waters; few eggs and no larvae were collected from the northern gulfs. The abundance of anchovy eggs and larvae in shelf waters increased when sardine abundance was reduced by large-scale mortality events, and decreased as the sardine numbers subsequently recovered. We hypothesize that the upwelling zones provide optimal conditions for the survival of larval anchovy in South Australia, but that anchovy can only utilize these zones effectively when the sardine population is low. At other times, northern gulf waters of South Australia may provide a refuge for the anchovy that the sardine cannot utilize.},

	OPTabstract = {The Bayesian approach to stock assessment determines the probabilities of alternative hypotheses using information for the stock in question and from inferences for other stocks/species. These probabilities are essential if the consequences of alternative management actions are to be evaluated through a decision analysis. Using the Bayesian approach to stock assessment and decision analysis it becomes possible to admit the full range of uncertainty and use the collective historical experience of fisheries science when estimating the consequences of proposed management actions. Recent advances in computing algorithms and power have allowed methods based on the Bayesian approach to be used even for fairly complex stock assessment models and to be within the reach of most stock assessment scientists. However, to avoid coming to ill-founded conclusions, care must be taken when selecting prior distributions. In particular, selection of priors designed to be noninformative with respect to 
quantities of interest to management is problematic. The arguments of the paper are illustrated using New Zealand's western stock of hoki, Macruronus novaezelandiae {(Merlucciidae)} and the {Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort} Seas stock of bowhead whales as examples},

	OPTabstract = {In the mid 1970s, the fishery catch of postlarval Japanese anchovy {(Engraulis} japonica) in a shelf region of the Enshu-nada Sea, off the central Pacific coast of Japan, started to decline corresponding to a rapid increase of postlarval sardine {(Sardinops} melanostictus). In late 1980s, sardine started to decline, and it was replaced by anchovy in the 1990s. This alternating dominance of postlarval sardine and anchovy corresponded to the alternation in egg abundance of these two species in the spawning habitat of this sea. It was also noteworthy that during the period of sardine decline, sardine spawning occurred in {April–May}, a delay of two months compared with spawning in the late {1970s.The} implication of oceanographic changes in the spawning habitat for the alternating dominance of sardine and anchovy eggs was explored using time-series data obtained in 1975–1998, focusing on the effect of the Kuroshio meander. Large meanders of the Kuroshio may have enhanced the onshore intrusion of 
the warm water into the shelf region and contributed to an increase in temperature in the spawning habitat. This might favour sardine, because its egg abundance in the shelf region was more dependent on the temperature in early spring than was that of anchovy. In addition, enhanced onshore intrusion could contribute to transport of sardine larvae from upstream spawning grounds of the Kuroshio region. On the other hand, anchovy egg abundance was more closely related to lower transparency at the shelf edge, which may indicate the prevalence and prolonged residence of the coastal water, and therefore higher food availability, frequently accompanying non-meandering {Kuroshio.The} expansion/shrinkage of the spawning habitat of sardine and anchovy in the shelf region, apparently responding to the change in the Kuroshio, possibly makes the alternation in dominance of postlarval sardine and anchovy most prominent in the Enshu-nada Sea, in combination with changes in the abundance of spawning adults, which occurred 
almost simultaneously in the overall Kuroshio region. The implication of this rather regional feature for the alternating dominance of sardine and anchovy populations on a larger spatial scale is also discussed.},

From juvenile landings collected over 38 years, the thresholds of environmental factors were determined that limited the optimal environmental window {(OEW)} for sardine {(Sardina} pilchardus recruitment success in the northwestern Iberian peninsula. The environmental factors considered were: water column stability in February, offshore water transport in {March–April} {(QxMA)}, upwelling intensity in the preceding year from May to August {(QxMJJA)}, and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation {(NAO)} index. From 1875 to the mid-1920s, the mean number of years within the {OEW} was relatively constant. However, since the mid-1920s, there have been oscillations and alternating decades with high and low number of years within the {OEW}, which were related to oscillations in sardine landings. From 1906 to 2000, there were four 
record, low sardine catches in the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s and 1990s, related to a high number of successive years with prevailing conditions out of the {OEW.} From 1875 to the present, a high year-to-year variation of the {NAO}, {QxMJJA} and water stability in February was observed, although with mean values usually within the {OEW.} The collapse in the 1950s was related, partly, to successive years with low {QxMJJA.} Successive years with high {NAO} values may be related to the collapse of the sardine fishery in the 1990s. {QxMA} has been the most significant factor controlling {SRS} in this area, being the factor related to the low catches observed in the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s. Water stability was not responsible for any of the collapses observed, but since the 1920s, there has been a significant trend toward decreasing water column stability before the onset of the spring bloom.},

	OPTabstract = {The Bayesian state-space modelling framework allows us to derive inferences on stochastic stage-structured population dynamics models from multiple series of sequential observations with measurement or sampling errors. A state-space model works from the coupling of two models. The first one mimics the dynamics by conditional Markovian transitions between successive hidden states. The second model describes the observation process with random errors. Statistical inferences on states variables and parameters are easily performed via Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chains {(MCMC)} methods. The flexibility of {MCMC} methods allows us to analyse a wide range of state-space models with non-linear relationships in the dynamic and observation equations, and {non-Gaussian} error structure just as well. The Bayesian paradigm is efficient for deriving quantitative diagnostics on a probability based rationale. We illustrate the value of this framework by fitting a stage-structured life cycle model for 
Atlantic salmon {(Salmo} salar) to a data set resulting from the survey of the population of the river Oir {(Lower} Normandy, France) between 1984 and 2001. The system dynamics includes non-linear regulation and has a probabilistic structure accommodating for both the environmental and the demographic stochasticity. The observation model consists in capture-mark-recapture experiments for the evaluation of the runs of downstream migrating juveniles (smolts) and upstream migrating spawners, and random sampling for demographic features. A full Bayesian treatment of the model is carried out by means of Gibbs sampling. Outputs of main interest consist in the joint posterior distribution of all the model parameters and state variables such as the smolt and spawner runs.},

Landings were more highly correlated with non-lagged environmental variables and in particular with Guadiana river flow. Both techniques gave coherent results, with the most important trend being a steady decline over time. A {DFA} model with two explanatory variables {(Guadiana} river flow and number of fishermen) and three common trends (smoothing functions over time) gave good fits to 10 of the 12 species. Results of other 
models indicated that river flow is the more important explanatory variable in this model. Changes in the mean flow and discharge regime of the Guadiana river resulting from the construction of the Alqueva dam, completed in 2002, are therefore likely to have a significant and deleterious impact on Algarve fisheries landings.},

Biological data were collected from purse seine and mid-water pelagic trawl commercial catches landed in Sciacca {(Sicily)} over 6 yr (1997–2002) at fortnightly intervals, analysing a total of 84 581 individuals. No inter-annual changes in length at first reproduction were observed, with a mean pooled value of 11.26 cm for both sexes being found. Spawning intensity, indicated by gonadosomatic index, condition factor and length–weight relationships, seem to be governed by food availability prior to spawning. Anchovy reproductive investment was limited by the area's low primary production. There was a synchrony between reproductive cycle and temperature. Water warming marks the 
onset of a period of high water stability in the area, and its later cooling marks the onset of a period with low water stability. The relationship between reproductive cycle and temperature is therefore probably a reproductive strategy having evolved to ensure that spawning takes place during the period of the year when water column stability is higher, favouring food concentration and egg and larval retention in the spawning areas.},

	OPTabstract = {Abstract Over the past two decades, populations of rockfish Sebastes spp. off the {U.S.} West Coast have declined sharply, leading to heightened concern about the sustainability of current harvest policies for these populations. In this paper, I develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to jointly estimate the stock−recruit relationships of rockfish stocks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Stock−recruit curves for individual stocks are linked using a prior distribution for the “steepness” parameter of the {Beverton–Holt} stock−recruit curve, defined as the expected recruitment at 20\% of unfished biomass relative to unfished recruitment. The choice of a spawning biomass per recruit ({SPR)} harvest rate is considered a problem in decision theory, in which different options are evaluated in the presence of uncertainty in the stock−recruit relationship. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to obtain the marginal distributions of variables of interest to management, such as the yield at a given 
{
SPR} rate. A wide range of expected yield curves were obtained for different rockfish stocks. The stocks of Pacific ocean perch S. alutus in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands are apparently the most resilient, with maximum sustainable yield ({MSY)} harvest rates greater than F 30\% (the fishing mortality rate that reduces {SPR} to 30\% of its unfished value) for all model configurations. In contrast, the {MSY} harvest rate for the West Coast stock of Pacific ocean perch was lower than F 70\%. The {SPR} rates at {MSY} for other stocks were clustered between F 40\% and F 60\% and depended on both the stock−recruit model ({Beverton–Holt} or Ricker) and the model for recruitment variability (lognormal or gamma). Meta-analysis results should be interpreted cautiously due to autocorrelation in the model residuals for several stocks and the potential confounding effect of decadal variation in ecosystem productivity. An F 40\% harvest rate, the current default harvest rate for rockfish, exceeded the 
estimated F {MSY} rate for all West Coast rockfish stocks with the exception of black rockfish S. melanops. A harvest rate of F 50\% is suggested as a risk-neutral F {MSY} proxy for rockfish. A more risk-averse alternative would be to apply an {SPR} harvest rate in the F {55\%−F} 60\% range.},

Combining different stockrecruit data sets of related species through Bayesian hierarchical analysis can decrease these uncertainties and help to characterize appropriate stockrecruit forms and ranges of plausible parameter values. Two different stockrecruit functions ({BevertonHolt} and Ricker) have been parameterized in terms of the steepness, which is a parameter that is comparable between populations. In the hierarchical analysis, the prior probability distribution of parameters for the cross-population variation in steepness is determined through a concise model structure. By calculating the Bayes' posteriors for alternative model forms, model uncertainty is accounted for. This methodology has been applied to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stockrecruit data to provide predictions for the steepness of the 
stockrecruit function ..., Les fonctions stockrecrutement sont de grande importance pour l'évaluation des stocks des pêches commerciales, mais il y a souvent de l'incertitude au sujet du choix d'un modèle approprié et des valeurs de ses paramètres.

Uncertainty affects the behaviour of fishers and fisheries regulators in a way that can adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks, fisheries income, and productivity. In agriculture, there has been a long history of using levy funds and public and private insurance schemes to mediate economic risks to growers resulting from environmental variability and quarantine risks. In the United States, the federal government continues to underwrite funds (collected by contracted private agents) that are used to protect contributors from the effects of extreme weather and pest and disease losses. In Europe, there are examples of industry-based mutual funds to mediate risks from exotic agricultural diseases. In agriculture, insurance mechanisms have been successful in reducing risk-inducing behaviour by contractual 
compliance to risk-reducing codes of practice. For fisheries, insurance may provide a tool to address some elements of uncertainty in a way that would help both the fishing industry and the regulators achieve objectives of sustainability, income security, and productivity. This paper presents a brief review of insurance in agriculture and capture fisheries and uses a stochastic model to illustrate how insurance funds could protect revenue and encourage increased sustainability of fisheries and improve compliance with and enforcement of fisheries regulation. Although insurance may be a partial solution to unsatisfactory fisheries management and fishing performance, some potential challenges to this novel approach are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a simulation study that evaluated the {ICES} scientific advisory process used to recommend total allowable catches ({TACs}) for flatfish stocks. Particular emphasis is given to examining the effects on stock biomass, yield and stability of constraining interannual variation in {TACs}. A “management strategy evaluation” approach is used where an operating model is used to represent the underlying reality, and pseudo data are generated for use within a management procedure. The management procedure comprises a stock assessment that uses data to estimate parameters of interest and a decision rule to derive {TAC} recommendations for the following year. Bounds on {TAC} of between 20\% and 40\% have little effect on yields or stability, while a 10\% bound on {TAC} can affect the ability to achieve management targets and result in low-frequency cycling in the stock. In the short term, performance is highly dependent on current stock status but bounds have less effect if the stock 
is close to equilibrium for a target fishing mortality (F). In addition, it was shown that current {ICES} biomass and fishing mortality reference points are not always consistent, and several are clearly inappropriate. Importantly, including realistic sources and levels of uncertainty can result in far from optimal management outcomes based on the current procedures. Results also conflicted with expert opinion, in suggesting that management based on a fixed F regime could result in relatively stable yields despite fluctuations in year-class strength and that the management feedback process itself is implicated in causing fluctuations in the system due to significant time-lags in this process. We therefore emphasize that providing more precise population estimates or developing harvest control rules alone will not necessarily help in achieving management objectives, rather management procedures that are robust to uncertainty and tuned to meet management objectives need to be developed. Operating models in 
these simulations were constrained to be based on existing {ICES} methods and perceptions of stock dynamics, but we recommend that, in future, operating models that represent the best available understanding of the actual system dynamics be used to evaluate models and rules considered for application.},

The {FLR} framework (Fisheries Library for R) is a development effort directed towards the evaluation of fisheries management strategies. The overall goal is to develop a common framework to facilitate collaboration within and across disciplines (e.g. biological, ecological, statistical, mathematical, economic, and social) and, in particular, to ensure that new modelling methods and software are more easily validated and evaluated, as well as becoming widely available once developed. Specifically, the framework details how to implement and link a variety of fishery, biological, and economic software packages so that alternative management strategies and procedures can be evaluated for 
their robustness to uncertainty before implementation. The design of the framework, including the adoption of object-orientated programming, its feasibility to be extended to new processes, and its application to new management approaches (e.g. ecosystem affects of fishing), is discussed. The importance of open source for promoting transparency and allowing technology transfer between disciplines and researchers is stressed.},
